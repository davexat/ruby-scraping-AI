Moxie Marlinspike has a privacy-conscious alternative to ChatGPT,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/18/moxie-marlinspike-has-a-privacy-conscious-alternative-to-chatgpt/,"If you’re at all concerned about privacy, the rise of AI personal assistants can feel alarming. It’s difficult to use one without sharing personal information, which is retained by the model’s parent company. With OpenAI already testing advertising, it’s easy to imagine the same data collection that fuels Facebook and Google creeping into your chatbot conversations. A new project, launched in December by Signal co-founder Moxie Marlinspike, is showing what a privacy-conscious AI service might look like. Confer is designed to look and feel like ChatGPT or Claude, but the backend is arranged to avoid data collection, with the open-source rigor that makes Signal so trusted. Your Confer conversations can’t be used to train the model or target ads, for the simple reason that the host will never have access to them. For Marlinspike, those protections are a response to the intimate nature of the service. “It’s a form of technology that actively invites confession,” says Marlinspike. “Chat interfaces like ChatGPT know more about people than any other technology before. When you combine that with advertising, it’s like someone paying your therapist to convince you to buy something.”  Ensuring that privacy requires several different systems working in concert. First, Confer encrypts messages to and from the system using the WebAuthn passkey system. (Unfortunately, that standard works best on mobile devices or Macs running Sequoia, although you can also make it work on Windows or Linux with a password manager.) On the server side, all Confer’s inference processing is done in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), with remote attestation systems in place to verify the system hasn’t been compromised. Inside that, there’s an array of open-weight foundation models handling whatever query comes in.  The result is a lot more complicated than a standard inference setup (which is fairly complicated already), but it delivers on Confer’s basic promise to users. As long as those protections are in place, you can have sensitive conversations with the model without any information leaking out. Confer’s free tier is limited to 20 messages a day and five active chats. Users willing to pay $35 a month will get unlimited access, along with more advanced models and personalization. That’s quite a bit more than ChatGPT’s Plus plan — but privacy doesn’t come cheap."
"Musk wants up to $134B in OpenAI lawsuit, despite $700B fortune",https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/17/musk-wants-up-to-134b-in-openai-lawsuit-despite-700b-fortune/,"Elon Musk wants a jaw-dropping $79 billion to $134 billion in damages from OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming the AI company defrauded him by jettisoning its nonprofit mission, Bloomberg first reported. The figure comes from expert witness C. Paul Wazzan, a financial economist whose bio says he has been deposed nearly 100 times and testified at trial more than a dozen times in complex commercial litigation cases. Wazzan, who specializes in valuation and damages calculations in high-stakes disputes, determined that Musk is entitled to a hefty portion of OpenAI’s current $500 billion valuation based on his $38 million seed donation when he co-founded the startup in 2015. (If you’re wondering, that would mean a 3,500-fold return on Musk’s investment.) Wazzan’s analysis combines Musk’s initial financial contributions with the technical know-how and business contributions he offered to OpenAI’s early team, calculating wrongful gains of $65.5 billion to $109.4 billion for OpenAI and $13.3 billion to $25.1 billion for Microsoft, which today owns a 27% chunk of the company. Musk’s legal team argues he should be compensated as an early startup investor who sees returns “many orders of magnitude greater” than his initial investment. But the sheer scale of the damages demand underscores that this legal battle isn’t really about the money. Musk’s personal fortune currently hovers around $700 billion, making him by far the world’s richest person. As Reuters recently noted, his wealth now exceeds that of Google co-founder Larry Page, the world’s second-richest person, by a stunning $500 billion, according to Forbes’ billionaires list. In November, Tesla shareholders separately approved a $1 trillion pay package for Musk, the largest corporate pay package in history. Against this backdrop, even a $134 billion payout from OpenAI would represent a relatively modest addition to Musk’s wealth, likely reinforcing for those at OpenAI their characterization of the lawsuit as part of an “ongoing pattern of harassment” rather than a legitimate financial grievance. OpenAI already reportedly sent a letter Thursday to investors and others of its business partners, warning that Musk will make “deliberately outlandish, attention-grabbing claims” as his lawsuit against the company heads to trial in April. The case will be heard in Oakland, Calif., about 15 miles east of San Francisco."
AI cloud startup Runpod hits $120M in ARR — and it started with a Reddit post  ,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/ai-cloud-startup-runpod-hits-120m-in-arr-and-it-started-with-a-reddit-post/,"Runpod, an AI app hosting platform that launched four years ago, has hit a $120 million annual revenue run rate, founders Zhen Lu and Pardeep Singh tell TechCrunch.   Their startup journey is a wild example of how if you build it well and the timing is lucky, they will definitely come. The story includes bootstrapping their way to over $1 million in revenue; landing a $20 million seed round after VC Radhika Malik, a partner at Dell Technologies Capital, saw some Reddit posts; and gaining another key angel investor, Hugging Face co-founder Julien Chaumond, because he was using the product and reached out over the support chat, the founders tell TechCrunch.  It all began in late 2021 when the two friends, who worked together as corporate developers for Comcast, decided the hobby they were doing wasn’t fun anymore.  They had built setups of specialized computers used to generate Ethereum in their respective New Jersey basements. While they did successfully mine a bit of the cryptocurrency, it wasn’t enough to pay back their investment, they said. Plus, mining was going to end after the much-ballyhooed network upgrade called “The Merge.”  On top of that, it was “boring” after a couple of months, Lu said.  But they had talked their wives into letting them spend a good $50,000 on the hobby between them, they estimated. Lu and Singh knew that home harmony depended on finding a way to use those GPUs.  The devs had been engaged in machine learning projects at work, so they opted to convert their mining rigs into AI servers. This was before ChatGPT, even before DALL-E 2.  As they repurposed the rigs, “We were seeing how really god-awful the software stack was for dealing with these GPUs,” Lu said. As developers, they found a problem they wanted to solve.   Runpod was born “because we felt that the actual experience of developing software on top of GPUs was just hot garbage,” Lu described.  A few months later in early 2022, they were ready to share what they had built. Runpod is a platform for hosting AI apps, emphasizing speed, easily configured hardware (including a serverless option that automates configuration), and dev tools like APIs, command-line interfaces, and other integrations.   Back in 2021, they only had a few such integrations (like support for popular web app tool Jupyter notebooks). The next problem: finding beta testers.  “As first-time founders, we didn’t really know how to market or how to do anything,” Lu recalled. “So I’m like, all right, let’s just post on Reddit.”  So, they posted in a couple of AI-oriented subreddits. The offer was simple: free access to their AI servers in exchange for feedback. It worked. They landed beta customers, which led to paying customers. Within nine months, they had quit their jobs and hit $1 million in revenue, they said.  But that led to another problem. “Six months in, business users were like, ‘Hey, I want to actually run real business stuff on your platform. But I cannot run it on servers that are in people’s basements,” Lu said.  It had not occurred to the New Jersey founders to raise capital from VCs. Instead they formed revenue-share partnerships with data centers to grow capacity. But it was stressful. The founders needed to stay three steps ahead.  “If we don’t have the GPUs, the market sentiment, the user sentiment changes. Because when they don’t see capacity from you, they go somewhere else,” Singh described.  Meanwhile, their user base was growing on Reddit and Discord, especially after ChatGPT launched. VCs were also on the prowl for investments. Malik saw them on Reddit and reached out, their first VC call. But Lu didn’t know how to pitch to an investor. “Radhika was super helpful, even at the first conversation,” he said. She basically explained to him how a VC thinks and told him she’d stay in touch.   Meanwhile, Lu had a business to run that had to pay for itself. “It was almost two years where we really didn’t have any funding,” he said. So Runpod never offered a free tier. It had to at least pay for itself, even if it wasn’t throwing off much profit. Unlike other AI cloud services that began as crypto miners, these founders refused to take on debt, they said.  By May 2024, with AI app fever spreading, their lucky decision to launch AI hosting for devs two years earlier was paying off. Their business had grown to 100,000 developers, and they landed a $20 million seed deal co-led by the VC arms of both Dell and Intel, with participation from big names like Nat Friedman and Chaumond.   They haven’t raised more money since but are now planning to, armed with a business that, they believe, should command a healthy Series A.  Today, Runpod counts 500,000 developers as customers, ranging from individuals to Fortune 500 enterprise teams with multimillion-dollar annual spend, the founders said.  Their cloud spans 31 regions globally and counts customers like Replit, Cursor, OpenAI, Perplexity, Wix, and Zillow as users. Competition is also fierce. Devs have all the major clouds to choose from (AWS, Microsoft, Google), plus plenty of industry-specific choices like CoreWeave and Core Scientific.  But they also see their place in the world a bit differently — as a dev-centric platform. They don’t see coding ever going away but changing. Programmers will become AI agent creators and operators.  “Our goal is to be what this next generation of software developers grows up on,” Lu said.  "
California AG sends Musk’s xAI a cease-and-desist order over sexual deepfakes,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/california-ag-sends-musks-xai-a-cease-and-desist-order-over-sexual-deepfakes/,"Earlier this week, the California attorney general’s office announced that it was investigating xAI over reports that the startup’s chatbot, Grok, was being used to create nonconsensual sexual imagery of women and minors. On Friday, the government followed up by sending a cease-and-desist letter to the company, demanding that it take immediate action to stop the production of nonconsensual intimate images and CSAM — child sexual abuse material. “Today, I sent xAI a cease-and-desist letter, demanding the company immediately stop the creation and distribution of deepfake, nonconsensual, intimate images and child sexual abuse material,” said California AG Rob Bonta in a press release. “The creation of this material is illegal. I fully expect xAI to immediately comply. California has zero tolerance for [CSAM].” The AG’s office additionally claimed that xAI appeared to be “facilitating the large-scale production” of nonconsensual nudes, the likes of which are being “used to harass women and girls across the internet.” The agency said it expects xAI to prove that it is taking steps to address these issues within the next five days. At the heart of the backlash is Grok’s “spicy” mode feature, which xAI created to generate explicit content. The issue has spread beyond California; Japan, Canada, and Britain have opened investigations into Grok, and Malaysia and Indonesia have temporarily blocked the platform altogether. Despite xAI instituting some restrictions on its image-editing features late Wednesday, the California AG’s office moved ahead with its cease-and-desist letter. X’s safety account has previously denounced this kind of user activity, saying: “Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.” TechCrunch reached out to xAI for comment and was met with an automated email that says “Legacy Media Lies.” TC also reached out to the California AG’s office for more context. The advent of free generative AI tools has led to a disturbing swell of non-consensual sexual material. Many platforms have been grappling with this problem, not just X. The sordid activity has drawn the attention not just of state leaders but also of Congress. Indeed, on Thursday, lawmakers sent a letter to the executives of several companies — including X, Reddit, Snap, TikTok, Alphabet, and Meta — asking how they planned to stem the proliferation of sexualized deepfakes."
From OpenAI’s offices to a deal with Eli Lilly — how Chai Discovery became one of the flashiest names in AI drug development,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/from-openais-offices-to-a-deal-with-eli-lilly-how-chai-discovery-became-one-of-the-flashiest-names-in-ai-drug-development/,"Drug discovery, the art of identifying new molecules to develop pharmaceuticals, is a notoriously time-consuming and difficult process. Traditional techniques, like high-throughput screening, offer an expensive scattershot approach — one that is not often successful. However, a new breed of biotech companies are leveraging AI and advanced data technologies in an attempt to accelerate and streamline the process. Chai Discovery, an AI startup founded in 2024, is one such company. In a little over 12 months, its young co-founders have managed to raise hundreds of millions of dollars and rally the backing of some of Silicon Valley’s most influential investors, making it one of the flashiest firms in a growing industry. In December, the company completed its Series B, bringing in an additional $130 million and a valuation of $1.3 billion. Last Friday, Chai also announced a partnership with Eli Lilly, a deal in which the pharmaceutical giant will use the startup’s software to help develop new medicines. Chai’s algorithm, called Chai-2, is designed to develop antibodies — the proteins necessary to fight illnesses. The startup has said it hopes to serve as a kind of “computer-aided design suite” for molecules. It’s a critical moment for Chai’s particular field. The startup’s deal was announced shortly before Eli Lilly said it would also collaborate with Nvidia on a $1 billion partnership to create an AI drug discovery lab in San Francisco. This “co-innovation lab,” as it’s being called, will combine big data, compute resources, and scientific expertise, all in an attempt to accelerate the speed of new medicine development. The industry isn’t without its detractors. Some industry veterans seem to feel that — given how difficult traditional drug development is — these new technologies are unlikely to have a major impact. However, for every naysayer, there seem to be just as many believers. Elena Viboch, managing director at General Catalyst — one of Chai’s major backers — told TechCrunch that her firm is confident that companies that adopt the startup’s services will see results. “We believe the biopharma companies that move the most quickly to partner with companies like Chai will be the first to get molecules into the clinic, and will make medicines that matter,” Viboch said. “In practice that means partnering in 2026 and by the end of 2027 seeing first-in-class medicines enter into clinical trials.” Aliza Apple, the head of Lilly’s TuneLab program — which uses AI and machine learning to advance drug discovery — also expressed confidence in Chai’s product. “By combining Chai’s generative design models with Lilly’s deep biologics expertise and proprietary data, we intend to push the frontier of how AI can design better molecules from the outset, with the ultimate goal to help accelerate the development of innovative medicines for patients,” she said. Chai may have been founded less than two years ago, but the startup’s origins began around six years ago, amid conversations between its co-founders and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. One of those founders, Josh Meier, previously worked for OpenAI in 2018 on its research and engineering team. After he left the company, Altman messaged Meier’s old college friend, Jack Dent, to ask about a potential business opportunity. Meier and Dent had originally met in computer science classes at Harvard but, at the time, Dent was a Stripe engineer (another company Altman was an early backer of). Altman asked him if he thought Meier would be open to collaborating on a proteomics startup — that is, a company focused on the study of proteins. Altman “messaged me to say that everyone at OpenAI thought highly of him and asked if I thought he’d be open to working with them on a proteomics spinout,” Dent said. Dent told Altman “of course,” but there was just one hitch: Meier didn’t feel like the technology was quite “there” yet. The AI tech behind such firms — which leverage powerful algorithms — was still a growing field and far from where it needed to be. Meier was also pretty dead set on joining Facebook’s research and engineering team, which is what he would go on to do. At Facebook, Meier helped to develop ESM1, the first transformer protein-language model — an important precursor to the work Chai is currently doing. After Meier’s time at Facebook, he would spend three years at Absci, another AI biotech firm based around drug creation. By 2024, Meier and Dent finally felt prepared to tackle the proteomics company they had originally discussed with Altman. “Josh and I reached back out to Sam and told him we should pick up that conversation where we left off — and that we were starting Chai together,” Dent said. OpenAI ended up becoming one of Chai’s first seed investors. Meier and Dent actually founded Chai — along with their co-founders, Matthew McPartlon and Jacques Boitreaud — while working out of the AI giant’s offices in San Francisco’s Mission neighborhood. “They were kind enough to give us some office space,” Dent revealed. Now, a little over a year later, as Chai basks in the glow of its newfound partnership with Eli Lilly, Dent says that the key to the company’s fast growth has been assembling a team of hugely talented people. “We really just put our heads down and pushed the frontier of what these models are capable of,” said Dent. “Every line of code in our codebase is homegrown. We’re not taking LLMs off the shelf that are in the open source [ecosystem] and fine-tuning them. These are highly custom architectures.” General Catalyst’s Viboch told TechCrunch that she felt Chai was ready to hit the ground running. “There are no fundamental barriers to deployment of these models in drug discovery,” she said. “Companies will still need to take drug candidates through testing and clinical trials, but we believe there’ll be significant advantages to those who adopt these technologies — not just in compressing discovery timelines, but also in unlocking classes of medicines that have historically been difficult to develop.”"
ChatGPT users are about to get hit with targeted ads,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/chatgpt-users-are-about-to-get-hit-with-targeted-ads/,"An ongoing conversation — both within and outside of the tech community — has been about just how and when OpenAI, which is currently valued at $500 billion, will make money. Well, there’s one surefire way to do that, and that is through advertising. In the near term, that seems to be the AI giant’s plan, as it announced this week that limited ads are headed to certain ChatGPT users. In a blog post published Friday, OpenAI said that it will begin testing ads in the U.S. for both its free and Go tiers. (Go accounts, which cost $8 a month, were introduced globally on Friday.) The company frames this as a way to sustain free access while generating revenue from people who aren’t ready to commit to a paid subscription. For the time being, the company’s more expensive paid tiers — Pro, Plus, Business, and Enterprise — will not be getting any ads. The ads will appear at the bottom of a user’s conversation and will be targeted to the topic of discussion. Users will have some control over this situation, as they’ll be able to dismiss ads, see explanations for why they’re being shown particular ones, and also turn off personalization, which should defeat the ads’ targeted nature. The company has also made a commitment not to serve ads to users it believes are under the age of 18. OpenAI says that ChatGPT will maintain “answer independence,” meaning that, despite the incorporation of advertising, those ads will not influence the answers that the chatbot serves to users. The company has also promised not to sell users’ data to advertisers. This strategy could pay off in two ways. For users of the free and Go tiers, the company obviously stands to make a significant amount of ad revenue. At the same time, there will necessarily be certain users who appreciate the app but don’t appreciate the ads, which could conceivably drive an uptick in subscriptions to the platform’s more expensive accounts. OpenAI also wants everybody to know that it’s only sticking ads in its chatbot to help the world. In its blog post Friday, the company promised that its “pursuit of advertising is always in support of” its mission: that AGI “benefits all of humanity.” "
Trump administration wants tech companies to buy $15B of power plants they may not use,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/trump-administration-wants-tech-companies-to-buy-15b-of-power-plants-they-may-not-use/,"The Trump administration wants the largest electricity grid to add $15 billion worth of new power generation — and he wants tech companies to pay for it, even if they don’t need the capacity. The White House and the governors of several states in the region want grid operator PJM to hold an auction for 15-year contracts for new generating capacity. The administration said it wants tech companies to bid on the contracts even if they don’t ultimately need the power for their data centers. Demand from data centers is expected to increase nearly threefold over the next decade. PJM said it was reviewing the “statement of principles” and that it would soon release the results of a months-long planning process that is looking to add new capacity to the grid. The statement is nonbonding, though, and behind the scenes, PJM doesn’t appear to be jazzed about the administration attempting to force its hand. “We don’t have a lot to say on this,” PJM spokesman Jeffrey Shields told Bloomberg yesterday. “We were not invited to the event they are apparently having tomorrow and we will not be there.” PJM Interconnection, which covers 13 states in the Mid-Atlantic and the Midwest, serves more than 65 million people and includes the data center hotspot of northern Virginia. Electricity rates in 2025 were up about 10% to 15% in the region compared with the year before. In the last decade, PJM’s peak load has increased 10%, according to Monitoring Analytics, and it’s expected to increase another 6.5% in 2027. Much of the blame has been laid at the feet of tech companies and data center operators, which have been using increasing amounts of power for AI. The price of natural gas is also to blame. PJM is heavily dependent on the fossil fuel, and the price has soared recently. Monitoring Analytics, PJM’s independent monitor, says that about 60% of 2025’s price increases are the result of high prices for fossil fuels. Grid operators have been put in a bind as data centers have ramped up demand for electricity after more than a decade of zero growth.  Building new fossil fuel power plants is a years-long proposition costing hundreds of millions of dollars. Many utilities and power providers are hesitant to commit to those timelines and outlays. If the AI boom fizzles, they could be left with unprofitable power plants that are built to operate for decades.  Tech companies, which haven’t traditionally been in the power business, have instead been turning to renewables, which are cheaper, more modular, and faster to deploy. Solar and batteries have been an early winner. A typical solar farm can be built in about 18 months, and because it can be built in phases, can start delivering power before it’s complete. That aligns more closely with data center construction, allowing companies to manage risk on similar timelines."

The rise of ‘micro’ apps: non-developers are writing apps instead of buying them,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/the-rise-of-micro-apps-non-developers-are-writing-apps-instead-of-buying-them/,"It took Rebecca Yu seven days to vibe code her dining app. She was tired of the decision fatigue that comes from people in a group chat not being able to decide where to eat.  Armed with determination, Claude, and ChatGPT, Yu decided to just build a dining app from scratch — one that would recommend restaurants to her and her friends based on their shared interests.    “Once vibe-coding apps emerged, I started hearing about people with no tech backgrounds successfully building their own apps,” she told TechCrunch. “When I had a week off before school started, I decided it was the perfect time to finally build my application.”    So, she created the web app Where2Eat to help her and her friends find a place to eat.    Yu is part of the growing trend of people who, due to rapid advancements in AI technology, can easily build their own apps for personal use. Most are coding web applications, though they are also increasingly vibe coding mobile apps intended to run only on their own personal phones and devices. Some who are already registered as Apple developers are leaving their personal apps in beta on TestFlight.   It is a new era of app creation that is sometimes called micro apps, personal apps, or fleeting apps because they are intended to be used only by the creator (or the creator plus a select few other people) and only for as long as the creator wants to keep the app. They are not intended for wide distribution or sale.  For example, founder Jordi Amat told TechCrunch that he built a fleeting web gaming app for his family to play over the holidays and simply shut it down once the vacation was over.    Then there’s Shamillah Bankiya, a partner at Dawn Capital, who is building a podcast translation web app for personal use. Interestingly enough, Darrell Etherington, a former TechCrunch writer, now a vice president at SBS Comms, is also building his own personal podcast translation app. “A lot of people I know are using Claude Code, Replit, Bolt, and Lovable to build apps for specific use cases,” he said.    One artist told TechCrunch that he built a “vice tracker” for himself to see how many hookahs and drinks he was consuming each weekend.  Even professional developers are vibe coding personal apps. Software engineer James Waugh told TechCrunch he built a web app planning tool to help with his cooking hobby.  Because tools ranging from Claude Code to Lovable typically don’t require robust coding knowledge just to get to a functional app, we are witnessing the early rise of micro apps. These are apps that are extremely context-specific, address niche needs, and then “disappear when the need is no longer present,” Legand L. Burge III, a professor of computer science at Howard University, said.  “It’s similar to how trends on social media appear and then fade away,” Burge III continued. “But now, [it’s] software itself.”    Yu said she now has six more ideas she wants to code. “It’s really exciting to be alive right now,” she said.   In some ways, it was always easy for someone without much coding experience to create web apps via no-code platforms like Bubble and Adalo, which launched before LLMs became popular. What’s new is the rising ability to create personal, temporary apps for mobile devices, too. Also new: the growing realization that anyone can code just by describing, in regular language, the app they want. Mobile micro apps still aren’t as easy as their web counterparts. This is because the standard way to load an app on an iPhone is to download it from the App Store, which requires a paid Apple Developer account. But increasingly mobile vibe-coding startups like Anything (which raised $11 million, led by Footwork) and VibeCode (which raised a $9.4 million seed round from Seven Seven Six last year) have emerged to help people build mobile apps.  Christina Melas-Kyriazi, a partner at Bain Capital Ventures, compared this era of app building to social media and Shopify, “where all of a sudden it was really easy to create content or to create a store online, and then we saw an explosion of small sellers.” she said. Still, micro apps also have issues. Building and sharing the code with other people can become somewhat expensive given the subscriptions required, especially if all the costs are associated with just one app. Building an app also remains tedious for some. Yu, for example, said her dining app wasn’t hard to create; it was just very time-consuming. She had to lean on ChatGPT and Claude to help her understand some coding decisions. “Once I learned how to prompt and solve issues efficiently, building became much easier,” she said.   Then there are quality issues. Such personal apps may have bugs or critical security flaws — they can’t just be sold as-is to the masses.  But there is still significant potential in an era of personal app building, especially as AI and model reasoning, quality, and security become more sophisticated over time.   The software engineer, Waugh, said he once built an app for a friend who had heart palpitations. He built her a logger that let her record when she was having heart issues so she could more easily show her doctor. “Great example of a one-off personal software that helps you keep track of something important,” he told TechCrunch.   Another founder, Nick Simpson, told TechCrunch he was so bad at paying parking tickets — the consequence of San Francisco’s tough parking availability — that he decided to build an app that would automatically pay them after scanning the ticket. As a registered Apple developer, his app is in beta on TestFlight, but he said a bunch of his friends now want it, too.   Nevertheless, Burge III believes that these types of apps can open “exhilarating opportunities” for businesses and creators to create “hyper-personalized situational experiences.” Etherington added to that, saying he believes a day is dawning when people stop subscribing to apps that have monthly fees. Instead, they will just build their own apps for personal use. Melas-Kyriazi, meanwhile, expects to see the use of personal, fleeting apps the same way spreadsheets like Google Sheets or Excel were once used.    “It’s really going to fill the gap between the spreadsheet and a full-fledged product,” she said.   One media strategist, Hollie Krause, said she didn’t like the apps her doctor kept recommending, so she built one herself that can help her track her allergies.  She had no technical experience and finished the web app in the same time it took her husband to go to dinner and back. Now, she said, they have two web apps, both built with Claude: one for allergies and sensitivities, and the other to keep tabs on chores around the house.   “I was like ‘wow I hate Excel but I’d love to make an app for our household,” Krause told TechCrunch. “So, I spun it up and hosted it on Tiiny.host and popped it on our cellphones.”    She thinks vibe coding will bring “a lot of innovation and problem solving for communities that wouldn’t have access otherwise,” and hopes to beta-test her allergy health app so she can one day release it to others.   “The app will be to help others who struggle to navigate life for themselves, and for caregivers to also be able to have access,” she said. “I truly think that vibe coding means I can help people.”"
Anthropic taps former Microsoft India MD to lead Bengaluru expansion,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/15/anthropic-taps-former-microsoft-india-md-to-lead-bengaluru-expansion/,"Anthropic has appointed Irina Ghose, a former Microsoft India managing director, to lead its India business as the U.S. AI startup prepares to open an office in Bengaluru. The move underscores how India is becoming a key battleground for AI companies looking to expand beyond the U.S. for major growth markets. Ghose brings deep big-tech operating experience to the role. She spent 24 years at Microsoft before stepping down in December 2025. Her appointment gives Anthropic a seasoned executive with local enterprise and government relationships as it gears up to establish an on-the-ground presence in one of the world’s fastest-growing AI markets. India has become one of Anthropic’s most strategically important markets, with the country already ranking as the second-largest user base for Claude and usage heavily skewing toward technical and work-related tasks, including software development. Arch-rival OpenAI is also sharpening its focus on the market with plans to open an office in New Delhi — a sign India is fast becoming one of the most contested arenas in the global race to commercialize generative AI. While India offers enormous scale — with more than a billion internet subscribers and over 700 million smartphone users — converting that reach into meaningful revenue has proven difficult, pushing AI companies to experiment with aggressive pricing and promotions. OpenAI last year introduced ChatGPT Go, its under-$5 plan aimed at attracting Indian users, and later made it available free for a year in the country. Similar dynamics are playing out for Anthropic: Its Claude app recorded a 48% increase from the previous year in downloads in India in September, reaching about 767,000 installs, while consumer spending surged 572% to $195,000 for the month, per Appfigures — still modest compared with the U.S., where September spending hit $2.5 million. Anthropic has been stepping up its engagement in India at the highest levels. Chief executive Dario Amodei visited in October and met corporate executives and lawmakers, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to discuss the company’s expansion plans and growing adoption of its tools. Anthropic had also explored a potential partnership with billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries to broaden access to Claude, as TechCrunch reported previously. Reliance, however, ultimately struck a deal with Google to offer its Gemini AI Pro plan free to Jio subscribers. That move came as rival Bharti Airtel partnered with Perplexity to bundle access to its premium subscription, underscoring how India’s telecom giants have become critical distribution gatekeepers in the race to scale consumer AI services. In a LinkedIn post announcing the move, Ghose said she would focus on working with Indian enterprises, developers, and startups adopting Claude for “mission-critical” use cases, pointing to growing demand for what she described as “high-trust, enterprise-grade AI.” She added that AI tailored to local languages could be a “force multiplier” across sectors including education and healthcare — signaling Anthropic’s intent to deepen adoption beyond early tech users into larger institutions and the public sector. The push by Anthropic, OpenAI, and Perplexity comes as India’s homegrown GenAI ecosystem remains relatively early-stage. While the country has a deep pool of software talent and a fast-growing base of AI users, it has produced few startups building large foundation models, with investors instead largely backing application-layer companies rather than committing the scale of capital typically required to train frontier systems. The appointment also comes ahead of India’s AI Impact Summit 2026 in February, where the Indian government is expected to bring together AI startups, global CEOs, and industry experts to discuss the next phase of AI deployment in the country. The summit is part of New Delhi’s broader effort to signal support for domestic AI development and position India as a serious player in the global AI landscape, as competition intensifies across major markets. Anthropic is also building out its India team, with job listings for roles including startup and enterprise account executives as well as a partner sales manager, signaling a push to deepen its go-to-market efforts and tap Indian businesses and startups as customers as it expands its presence in the country. For Anthropic, the hire adds senior local leadership as it looks to turn India’s surging usage into a durable business, navigating a market where distribution partnerships, pricing pressure, and enterprise adoption will shape which AI players emerge as long-term winners."
Silicon Valley’s messiest breakup is definitely headed to court,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/15/silicon-valleys-messiest-breakout-is-definitely-headed-to-court/,"OpenAI and Microsoft tried to dodge a courtroom showdown with Elon Musk, but a federal judge wasn’t having it, as reported earlier by Bloomberg. On Thursday she rejected their dismissal requests and set the case for a jury trial in late April, meaning they’ll officially duke it out in an Oakland courtroom, with Microsoft also dragged into the legal battle. The backstory reads like a tech soap opera. Musk and Sam Altman co-founded OpenAI with others in 2015 as a nonprofit with lofty charitable goals. But those fuzzy feelings didn’t last — Musk left and in 2023 started his own AI company, xAI, and now claims his former partners betrayed their mission by taking billions from Microsoft and restructuring as a for-profit. The relationships have seemingly curdled across the board. OpenAI and Microsoft remain business partners but increasingly compete head-to-head in AI. Meanwhile, Musk and Altman have gone from collaborators to archenemies, with OpenAI dismissing Musk’s lawsuit as “baseless” and “harassment” and an attempt to slow it down. The judge found enough evidence to let a jury decide whether OpenAI broke its nonprofit commitments. A jury will also now decide whether Microsoft knowingly helped OpenAI break its promises, though the judge dismissed Musk’s claim that Microsoft unjustly enriched itself at his expense. "
AI journalism startup Symbolic.ai signs deal with Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/15/ai-journalism-startup-symbolic-ai-signs-deal-with-rupert-murdochs-news-corp/,"Newsrooms have been experimenting with AI for several years now but, for the most part, those efforts have been just that: experiments. A relatively unknown startup, Symbolic.ai, wants to change that, and it just signed a major deal with News Corp, the media conglomerate owned by Rupert Murdoch. News Corp, the major assets of which include MarketWatch, the New York Post, and The Wall Street Journal, is set to begin using Symbolic’s AI platform with its financial news hub Dow Jones Newswires. Symbolic.ai, which was founded by former eBay CEO Devin Wenig and Ars Technica co-founder Jon Stokes, says its AI platform can “assist in the production of quality journalism and content” and that its tool has even led to “productivity gains of as much as 90% for complex research tasks.” The platform is designed to make editorial workflows more efficient, providing improvements in areas like newsletter creation, audio transcription, fact-checking, “headline optimization,” SEO advice, and others. In general, News Corp has shown a willingness to integrate AI into its media operations. In 2024, the company signed a multi-year partnership with OpenAI, wherein it would license its material to the AI company. Last November, the media conglomerate signaled that it was considering branching out, and licensing its material to other AI companies."
The AI lab revolving door spins ever faster,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/15/the-ai-lab-revolving-door-spins-ever-faster/,"AI labs just can’t get their employees to stay put. Yesterday’s big AI news was the abrupt and seemingly acrimonious departure of three top executives at Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab. All three were quickly snapped up by OpenAI, and now it seems they won’t be the last to leave. Alex Heath is reporting that two more employees are expected to leave for OpenAI in the next few weeks. Meanwhile, Anthropic continues to pull alignment researchers away from OpenAI. The Verge is reporting that one of OpenAI’s senior safety research leads, Andrea Vallone, has left the company for Anthropic. Vallone specializes in how AI models respond to mental health issues — which is a particularly sensitive issue for OpenAI after its recent sycophancy problems. As The Verge notes, Vallone will be working under alignment researcher Jan Leike, who left OpenAI in 2024 over concerns the company wasn’t taking safety seriously enough. If that wasn’t enough, OpenAI finished things off with one last major poach. Max Stoiber, formerly the director of engineering at Shopify, will be joining the company to work on OpenAI’s long-rumored operating system, in what he describes as a “small high-agency team.”"
Taiwan to invest $250B in US semiconductor manufacturing,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/15/taiwan-to-invest-250b-in-us-semiconductor-manufacturing/,"The Trump administration signed a notable multibillion-dollar trade deal with Taiwan that’s designed to help the United States boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing. Under the deal announced by the U.S. Department of Commerce on Thursday, Taiwanese semiconductor and tech companies have agreed to make direct investments of $250 billion into the U.S. semiconductor industry. These investments will span across semiconductors, energy, and AI “production and innovation,” according to a press release. Taiwan currently produces more than half of the world’s semiconductors. Taiwan will also supply an additional $250 billion in credit guarantees for additional investments from these semiconductors and tech enterprises, according to the commerce department. The time period of these investments is unclear. In return, the U.S. will invest in Taiwan’s semiconductor, defense, AI, telecommunications, and biotech industries. The press release did not specify a dollar amount tied to the U.S.’s side of the deal. The news comes the day after the Trump administration published a proclamation that reiterated the country’s goal to bring more semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States and acknowledged the process would take time, as only 10% of semiconductors are produced stateside. “This dependence on foreign supply chains is a significant economic and national security risk,” the proclamation stated. “Given the foundational role that semiconductors play in the modern economy and national defense, a disruption of import-reliant supply chains could strain the United States’ industrial and military capabilities.” The proclamation, which announced 25% of tariffs on some advanced AI chips, also stated that once trade talks with other countries — like this deal with Taiwan — are complete, there would be additional semiconductor tariffs."
"AI video startup, Higgsfield, founded by ex-Snap exec, lands $1.3B valuation",https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/15/ai-video-startup-higgsfield-founded-by-ex-snap-exec-lands-1-3b-valuation/,"Through an extension to its previous $50 million Series A round that closed in September, AI video generation startup Higgsfield has sold another $80 million worth of stock, bringing its total Series A to $130 million. The company says it has now hit a $1.3 billion valuation. Higgsfield offers a tool that allows consumers, creators, and social media teams to create and edit AI-generated videos. The company was founded by Alex Mashrabov, former head of Generative AI at Snap, who landed at the company after it bought his previous startup, AI Factory, in 2020 for $166 million. Mashrabov was a co-founder of AI Factory. Five months after Higgsfield launched its tool, it touted 11 million users and said it was a platform of choice for content creators. Nine months in, it has now reached over 15 million users and is on a $200 million annual revenue run rate, with that figure doubling from a $100 million trajectory in about two months, it says. The startup believes this puts it in rarified growth terrain, outpacing companies like Lovable, Cursor, OpenAI, Slack, and Zoom, according to its press release. To position itself less as an AI slop maker and more as a business tool, Higgsfield now emphasizes that the product is primarily used by professional social media marketers, “a major sign that the platform adoption has evolved beyond casual content creation.” Of course, it’s still an AI slop engine as well. Last month, Higgsfield was used to create a video called “Island Holiday” that depicted people mentioned in the Epstein files alongside fictional characters on “vacation” on Epstein’s island. (Because of its offensive nature, we’re not going to link to the viral X post.) On the other hand, its users also share plenty of projects centered on fashion and Hollywood-esque story telling, as well. Investors in the Series A extension include Accel, AI Capital Partners, Menlo Ventures, and GFT Ventures. "
The US imposes 25% tariff on Nvidia’s H200 AI chips headed to China,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/15/the-us-imposes-25-tariff-on-nvidias-h200-ai-chips-headed-to-china/,"After months of rumors that the Trump administration was going to impose tariffs on semiconductors, a tariff has been announced for some chips. The tariff only applies to certain semiconductors, including the Nvidia H200 advanced AI chips set to ship to China. President Donald Trump signed a proclamation on Wednesday that entailed a 25% tariff on advanced AI semiconductors that have been produced outside the U.S. and then pass through the U.S. before being exported to customers in other countries. This news formalizes a key component of the U.S. Department of Commerce’s decision to give Nvidia the green light to start shipping its H200 advanced AI chips to vetted customers in China in December. It also includes chips from other companies, including the AMD MI325X. In spite of the tariffs, Nvidia publicly cheered the move, which allows it to sell the chip to approved customers. “We applaud President Trump’s decision to allow America’s chip industry to compete to support high-paying jobs and manufacturing in America. Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America,” an Nvidia spokesperson emailed TechCrunch. There is demand for these H200 semiconductors. Nvidia was reportedly considering ramping up production on these chips due to a rush of early orders from Chinese companies. Demand is just one factor, though. The other is how the Chinese government decides to regulate these imports. China finds itself in a similar, yet different situation to the U.S. when it comes to chip production and the global AI race. China wants to boost its domestic semiconductor industry, but the country also doesn’t want to fall behind while it waits for its domestic tech to catch up to international rivals. The Chinese central government is working to draft rules and guidelines of how many semiconductors Chinese companies can purchase from overseas, according to reporting from Nikkei Asia. This would allow for some purchasing of Nvidia’s chips and would be a reversal from the country’s current adversity toward the chip imports. Wednesday’s executive order does not apply to chips that are imported into the U.S. and then used in the country for research, defense, or commercial purposes. “The United States currently fully manufactures only approximately 10% of the chips it requires, making it heavily reliant on foreign supply chains. This dependence on foreign supply chains is a significant economic and national security risk,” the proclamation stated."
OpenAI invests in Sam Altman’s brain computer interface startup Merge Labs,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/15/openai-invests-in-sam-altmans-brain-computer-interface-startup-merge-labs/,"Just when you thought the circular deals couldn’t get any more circular, OpenAI has invested in CEO Sam Altman’s brain computer interface (BCI) startup Merge Labs.  Merge Labs, which defines itself as a “research lab” dedicated to “bridging biological and artificial intelligence to maximize human ability,” came out of stealth on Thursday with an undisclosed seed round. A source familiar with the matter confirmed previous reports that OpenAI wrote the largest single check in Merge Labs’ $250 million seed round at an $850 million valuation. Investment firms Bain Capital, Interface Fund and Fifty Years also participated in the raise, alongside video game developer Gabe Newell. Seth Bannon, a founding partner at Fifty Years, wrote on X that Merge represents the culmination of the human effort to build tools that “extend ourselves and our capabilities.” “Our individual experience of the world arises from billions of active neurons,” reads a statement from Merge Labs. “If we can interface with these neurons at scale, we could restore lost abilities, support healthier brain states, deepen our connection with each other, and expand what we can imagine and create alongside advanced AI.” Merge Labs said it intends to reach these feats noninvasively by developing “entirely new technologies that connect with neurons using molecules instead of electrodes” to “transit and receive information using deep-reaching modalities like ultrasound.”  The move deepens Altman’s competition with Elon Musk, whose startup Neuralink is also developing computer interface chips that allow people who suffer from severe paralysis to control devices with their thoughts. Neuralink currently requires invasive surgery for implantation, where a surgical robot removes a small piece of skull and inserts ultra-fine electrode threads into the brain to read neural signals. The company last raised a $650 million Series E at a $9 billion valuation in June 2025.  While there are undoubtedly medical use cases for BCIs, Merge Labs seems more focused on using the technology to fulfill a Silicon Valley fantasy of combining human biology with AI to give us superhuman capabilities.  “Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) are an important new frontier,” OpenAI wrote in a blog post. “They open new ways to communicate, learn, and interact with technology. BCIs will create a natural, human-centered way for anyone to seamlessly interact with AI. This is why OpenAI is participating in Merge Labs’ seed round.”  Aside from Altman, other co-founders include Alex Blania (CEO) and Sandro Herbig (product and engineering lead) at Tools for Humanity, another Altman-backed company (and creator of the eye-scanning World orbs); Tyson Aflalo and Sumner Norman, co-founders of implantable neural tech company Forest Neurotech; and Mikhail Shapiro, a researcher at Caltech. Blania and Herbig said in separate social media posts that they would continue their roles at Tools for Humanity. Merge Labs did not confirm whether Alfalo and Norman would maintain their positions at Forest Neurotech, only saying that the company would continue operating and will have a “wonderful working relationship” with Merge. Shapiro intends to continue teaching at Caltech. A spokesperson told TechCrunch that the co-founders are also Merge Labs’ board members. As part of the deal, OpenAI will work with Merge Labs on scientific foundation models and other frontier tools to “accelerate progress.” In its blog post, OpenAI noted that AI will not only help accelerate R&D in bioengineering, neuroscience, and device engineering, but that the interfaces will also benefit from AI operating systems that “can interpret intent, adapt to individuals, and operate reliably with limited and noisy signals.” In other words, Merge Labs could function as a remote control for OpenAI’s software. That leads into the circular nature of the deal: If Merge Labs succeeds, it could drive more users to OpenAI, which then justifies OpenAI’s investment into the company. It also increases the value of a startup Altman owns using resources from a company he runs. OpenAI is also working with Jony Ive’s startup io, which it acquired last year, to produce a piece of AI hardware that doesn’t rely on a screen. Recent unconfirmed leaks suggest the device might be an earbud.  OpenAI primarily invests through the OpenAI Startup Fund, which has invested in several other startups connected to Altman, including Red Queen Bio, Rain AI, and Harvey. OpenAI has also entered into commercial agreements with startups Altman personally owns or chairs, including nuclear fusion startup Helion Energy and nuclear fission company Oklo. Altman has been dreaming about the “merge” — the idea that humans and machines will merge — since at least 2017 when he published a blog post guessing it would happen somewhere between 2025 and 2075. He also speculated that the merge could take many forms, including plugging electrons into our brains or becoming “really close friends with a chatbot.” He said a merge is our “best-case scenario” for humanity surviving against superintelligence AI, which he describes as a separate species that’s in conflict with humans.  “Although the merge has already begun, it’s going to get a lot weirder,” Altman wrote. “We will be the first species ever to design our own descendants. My guess is that we can either be the biological bootloader for digital intelligence and then fade into an evolutionary tree branch, or we can figure out what a successful merge looks like.” TechCrunch has reached out to OpenAI and Merge Labs for more information. This article has been updated to confirm that Merge Labs’ founders will continue work at their respective companies, and with more details about other fund participants. "
"Wikimedia Foundation announces new AI partnerships with Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Perplexity, and others",https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/15/wikimedia-foundation-announces-new-ai-partnerships-with-amazon-meta-microsoft-perplexity-and-others/,"As part of its 25th birthday celebration, the Wikimedia Foundation announced a series of new partnerships with AI tech companies that are now customers of its commercial product, Wikimedia Enterprise. Developed by the foundation, Wikimedia Enterprise allows large-scale reuse and distribution of Wikipedia content, as well as content from other Wikimedia projects. In addition to the previously announced partnership with Google in 2022, the organization shared publicly for the first time that it has formed other partnerships with Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Mistral AI, and Perplexity over the past year. Other partnerships, like Ecosia, Pleias, and ProRata, have been mentioned before but are also included in this announcement, along with Nomic and Reef Media. These deals give Wikipedia another way to sustain itself in an age where much of its content is being picked up and reused by AI models and other technology products and services to provide quick, factual answers to consumers’ queries. As an enterprise product, Wikimedia Enterprise isn’t just about getting tech companies to pay for their use; it also provides them access to Wikimedia projects at a volume and speed designed to meet their data needs. The foundation also noted in a blog post that Wikipedia today is among the top 10 most-visited websites globally, where audiences view more than 65 million articles in over 300 languages, nearly 15 billion times per month. “Wikipedia shows that knowledge is human, and knowledge needs humans. Especially now, in the age of AI, we need the human-powered knowledge of Wikipedia more than ever,” noted Wikimedia Foundation’s CPO/CTO, Selena Deckelmann, in a statement. “With continued help from readers, volunteer editors, donors, partners, and fans across the globe, Wikipedia will remain the crucial hub for human-powered knowledge and collaboration online for the next 25 years and beyond.” In addition to the tech deals announcement, the foundation launched a birthday campaign, which includes a new video docuseries offering a behind-the-scenes look at Wikipedia volunteers around the world. It also launched a “25 Years of Wikipedia” time capsule to explore the site’s past, present, and future, with some narration provided by founder Jimmy Wales. The organization will celebrate a livestreamed birthday event as well, on January 15, at 4:00 p.m. UTC, with guests, games, and entertainment. The event can be found on Wikipedia’s YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram channels. The organization’s birthday announcements additionally highlighted other recent advances, like upgrades to its tech infrastructure, its own approach to AI, new experiments like games and short-form video, and more.

"US senators demand answers from X, Meta, Alphabet, and others on sexualized deepfakes",https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/15/us-senators-demand-answers-from-x-meta-alphabet-on-sexualized-deepfakes/,"The tech world’s nonconsensual, sexualized deepfake problem is now bigger than just X. In a letter to the leaders of X, Meta, Alphabet, Snap, Reddit, and TikTok, several U.S. senators are asking the companies to provide proof that they have “robust protections and policies” in place and to explain how they plan to curb the rise of sexualized deepfakes on their platforms. The senators also demanded that the companies preserve all documents and information relating to the creation, detection, moderation, and monetization of sexualized, AI-generated images, as well as any related policies. The letter comes hours after X said it updated Grok to prohibit it from making edits of real people in revealing clothing and restricted image creation and edits via Grok to paying subscribers. (X and xAI are part of the same company.) Pointing to media reports about how easily and often Grok generated sexualized and nude images of women and children, the senators pointed out that platforms’ guardrails to prevent users from posting nonconsensual, sexualized imagery may not be enough. “We recognize that many companies maintain policies against non-consensual intimate imagery and sexual exploitation, and that many AI systems claim to block explicit pornography. In practice, however, as seen in the examples above, users are finding ways around these guardrails. Or these guardrails are failing,” the letter reads. Grok, and consequently X, have been heavily criticized for enabling this trend, but other platforms are not immune. Deepfakes first gained popularity on Reddit, when a page displaying synthetic porn videos of celebrities went viral before the platform took it down in 2018. Sexualized deepfakes targeting celebrities and politicians have multiplied on TikTok and YouTube, though they usually originate elsewhere. Meta’s Oversight Board last year called out two cases of explicit AI images of female public figures, and the platform has had nudify apps selling ads on its services, though it did sue a company called CrushAI later. There have been multiple reports of kids spreading deepfakes of peers on Snapchat. And Telegram, which isn’t included on the senators’ list, has also become notorious for hosting bots built to undress photos of women. In response to the letter, X pointed to its announcement regarding its update to Grok. “We do not and will not allow any non-consensual intimate media (NCIM) on Reddit, do not offer any tools capable of making it, and take proactive measures to find and remove it,” a Reddit spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “Reddit strictly prohibits NCIM, including depictions that have been faked or AI-generated. We also prohibit soliciting this content from others, sharing links to “nudify” apps, or discussing how to create this content on other platforms,” the spokesperson added. Alphabet, Snap, TikTok, and Meta did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The letter demands the companies provide: The letter is signed by Senators Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), and Adam Schiff (D-Calif.). The move comes just a day after xAI’s owner Elon Musk said that he was “not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok.” Later on Wednesday, California’s attorney general opened an investigation into xAI’s chatbot, following mounting pressure from governments across the world incensed by the lack of guardrails around Grok that allowed this to happen. xAI has maintained that it takes action to remove “illegal content on X, including [CSAM] and non-consensual nudity,” though neither the company nor Musk have addressed the fact that Grok was allowed to generate such content in the first place. The problem isn’t constrained to nonconsensual manipulated sexualized imagery either. While not all AI-based image generation and editing services let users “undress” people, they do let one easily generate deepfakes. To pick a few examples, OpenAI’s Sora 2 reportedly allowed users to generate explicit videos featuring children; Google’s Nano Banana seemingly generated an image showing Charlie Kirk being shot; and racist videos made with Google’s AI video model are garnering millions of views on social media. The issue grows even more complex when Chinese image and video generators come into the picture. Many Chinese tech companies and apps — especially those linked to ByteDance — offer easy ways to edit faces, voices, and videos, and those outputs have spread to Western social platforms. China has stronger synthetic content labeling requirements that don’t exist in the U.S. on the federal level, where the masses instead rely on fragmented and dubiously enforced policies from the platforms themselves. U.S. lawmakers have already passed some legislation seeking to rein in deepfake pornography, but the impact has been limited. The Take It Down Act, which became federal law in May, is meant to criminalize the creation and dissemination of nonconsensual, sexualized imagery. But a number of provisions in the law make it difficult to hold image-generating platforms accountable, as they focus most of the scrutiny on individual users instead. Meanwhile, a number of states are trying to take matters into their own hands to protect consumers and elections. This week, New York governor Kathy Hochul proposed laws that would require AI-generated content to be labeled as such, and ban nonconsensual deepfakes in specified periods leading up to elections, including depictions of opposition candidates."
Parloa triples its valuation in 8 months to $3B with $350M raise,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/15/parloa-triples-its-valuation-in-8-months-to-3b-with-350m-raise/,"Berlin-based Parloa has raised $350 million in Series D funding from existing investors, valuing the six-year-old customer service AI startup at $3 billion. The round comes just eight months after the company raised $120 million at a $1 billion valuation. The new round was led by General Catalyst, with participation from returning backers, including EQT Ventures, Altimeter Capital, Durable Capital, and Mosaic Ventures. Parloa is one of many startups developing AI agents that promise to automate the kind of customer service work previously handled by human representatives and help desk staff. The company’s competitors include Sierra, co-founded by OpenAI chairman Bret Taylor, which raised $350 million at a $10 billion valuation in September; and Decagon, reportedly in talks to raise capital at a valuation of upward of $4 billion. Other companies working to replace human agents with AI include older players Intercom and Kore.ai, as well as the U.K.-based PolyAI, which raised an $86 million round at a $750 million valuation last month. Malte Kosub, Parloa’s co-founder and CEO, doesn’t seem fazed by the competition, largely because he doesn’t believe this is a “winner-take-all” category. “In the end, it is one of the biggest opportunities that has ever existed in software,” he told TechCrunch.   Indeed, Parloa and its rivals are vying to automate a significant portion of the global customer support workforce, which Gartner estimates at 17 million contact center agents worldwide. But it’s not just the size of the market that gives Kosub confidence about Parloa’s ability to win. He pointed to the startup’s massive fundraise as a sign that it could be among the top leaders in the space. “There are a lot of companies out there, but you need to look at the scale and the amount of funding they got,” he said. “The number of competitors is decreasing significantly.” Last month, Parloa said that it was generating annual recurring revenue of more than $50 million, but that’s not meaningfully ahead of Poly AI, which expected to end 2025 with ARR of $40 million, or Decagon, which is reportedly making “significantly more” than $30 million in ARR. Still, Kosub seems convinced that being so well capitalized will help his startup get ahead. Parloa’s AI agents are already answering calls for large enterprise customers, which include Allianz, Booking.com, HealthEquity, SAP, Sedgwick, and Swiss Life, but the CEO says the goal is to do more than just build software that “picks up the phone.” The company will invest a significant portion of its new capital into building a “multi-model, contextual experience” that will allow personalized AI agents to recognize a customer’s identity and specific needs, whether they reach out via an app, a website, or a phone call."
"After Italy, WhatsApp excludes Brazil from rival chatbot ban",https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/15/after-italy-whatsapp-excludes-brazil-from-rival-chatbot-ban/,"WhatsApp is allowing AI providers to continue offering their chatbots to users with Brazilian phone numbers, days after the country’s competition regulator ordered Meta to suspend its new policy that bars third-party, general-purpose chatbots from being offered on the app via its business API. Under the new policy, the company is providing a 90-day grace period starting January 15 to developers and AI providers, mandating them to cease responding to user queries on the chat app and notify users that their chatbots won’t work on WhatsApp. Now Meta told developers that they don’t have to notify users with Brazilian phone numbers (with code +55) of any changes or cease offering their services, per a notice to AI providers seen by TechCrunch. “The requirement to cease responding to user queries and implement pre-approved auto-reply language (mentioned below) before January 15, 2026, no longer applies when messaging people with a Brazil country code (+55),” the notice reads. WhatsApp did not immediately respond to a query seeking to confirm the decision. The policy, which goes into effect from today, impacts general-purpose chatbots like ChatGPT and Grok on the platform. Notably, the policy does not stop businesses from providing customer service via bots within WhatsApp to their customers. In its notice, Brazil’s competition agency said it would investigate if Meta’s terms are exclusionary to competitors and unduly favor Meta AI, the company’s chatbot that’s offered on WhatsApp. Meta has previously provided a similar exemption to users in Italy after the country’s competition agency took issue with the policy in December. Separately, the EU has also opened an antitrust investigation into the new rules. The company has consistently maintained that AI chatbots are straining its systems that were designed for different uses of its business API. Meta has even said in the past that people who want to use different chatbots can do so outside WhatsApp. “These claims are fundamentally flawed,” a WhatsApp spokesperson said in response to CADE’s probe on Tuesday. “The emergence of AI chatbots on our Business API put a strain on our systems that they were not designed to support. This logic assumes WhatsApp is somehow a de facto app store. The route to market for AI companies is the app stores themselves, their websites and industry partnerships; not the WhatsApp Business Platform.”"
"Mira Murati’s startup, Thinking Machines Lab, is losing two of its co-founders to OpenAI",https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/mira-muratis-startup-thinking-machines-lab-is-losing-two-of-its-co-founders-to-openai/,"Former OpenAI exec Mira Murati’s startup, Thinking Machines Lab, is saying goodbye to two of its co-founders, both of whom are headed back to OpenAI. Another former OpenAI staffer who went to work for Murati’s startup is also headed back to the company. On social media on Wednesday, Murati announced the departure of Barret Zoph, the company’s co-founder and CTO. “We have parted ways with Barret Zoph,” Murati said in a post on X. “Soumith Chintala will be the new CTO of Thinking Machines. He is a brilliant and seasoned leader who has made important contributions to the AI field for over a decade, and he’s been a major contributor to our team. We could not be more excited to have him take on this new responsibility.” Murati’s announcement made no mention of other departures. Just 58 minutes after Murati’s announcement of Zoph’s departure, Fidji Simo, OpenAI’s CEO of applications, announced that Zoph would be headed back to OpenAI. “Excited to welcome Barret Zoph, Luke Metz, and Sam Schoenholz back to OpenAI! This has been in the works for several weeks, and we’re thrilled to have them join the team,” Simo wrote on X. Metz is another co-founder of Thinking Machines and previously worked for OpenAI for a number of years on the company’s technical staff. So did Schoenholz, whose LinkedIn profile still lists him as working for Thinking Machines. Zoph previously worked for OpenAI as VP of research, and before that, worked for six years at Google as a research scientist. Murati, who served as the CTO of OpenAI until September 2024, left the company and co-founded Thinking Machines with Zoph and Metz. The startup, where Murati serves as CEO, has amassed significant financial support since then, closing a $2 billion seed round last July, with participation from Andreessen Horowitz, which led the round, as well as Accel, Nvidia, AMD, and Jane Street, among others. The round valued the company at $12 billion. TechCrunch has reached out to both Thinking Machines and OpenAI for comment. Wired reports that the split between Zoph and Thinking Labs wasn’t amicable. Certainly, it’s telling that Murati didn’t write more in her public messaging about his departure from the company. While talent moves between AI giants are common in Silicon Valley, the departure of co-founders from a startup less than a year after its founding is particularly notable. The loss of two co-founders simultaneously — especially when one served as CTO — could be perceived as a particularly meaningful setback for Thinking Machines, which had assembled a high-profile team of former OpenAI, Meta, and Mistral AI researchers. The company has also lost other key personnel, including co-founder Andrew Tulloch, who left to join Meta in October. OpenAI itself has seen numerous co-founders depart to launch or join competing ventures, including John Schulman, who left for Anthropic in August 2024 before joining Thinking Machines as chief scientist at its launch in February of last year.

India’s Emversity doubles valuation as it scales workers AI can’t replace,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/indias-emversity-doubles-valuation-as-it-scales-workers-ai-cant-replace/,"As AI automates parts of the workforce, Emversity, an Indian workforce-training startup, is building talent pipelines for roles it sees AI can’t replace, and has raised $30 million in a new round to expand job-ready training in the world’s most populous market. The all-equity Series A round was led by Premji Invest, with participation from Lightspeed Venture Partners and Z47, the Bengaluru-based startup announced on Thursday. The funding values Emversity at around $120 million post-money, sources confirmed to TechCrunch, up from about $60 million in its April 2025 pre-Series A round. Total funding now stands at $46 million. India has been grappling with a widening skills gap, with graduates often entering the workforce without job-ready skills even as key service sectors struggle to hire trained staff. In healthcare, the Indian government says the country has about 4.3 million registered nursing personnel and 5,253 nursing institutions producing roughly 387,000 nurses annually, yet recent reports have continued to flag a shortage. Hospitality, too, has faced a 55% to 60% demand-supply gap for workers, according to industry estimates. Emversity is trying to bridge that gap by integrating employer-designed training programs into university curricula and running skill centers affiliated with the Indian government’s National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) for short-term certifications and placements. The two-year-old startup has partnered with 23 universities and colleges across over 40 campuses and focuses on “grey-collar” roles — positions that require hands-on training and credentialing — including nurses, physiotherapists, and medical lab technicians, as well as hospitality roles such as guest relations and food and beverage service. Emversity has trained about 4,500 learners so far and placed 800 candidates to date, founder and CEO Vivek Sinha (pictured above) said in an interview. Sinha, who previously served as chief operating officer at Indian edtech startup Unacademy for over three years before starting Emversity in 2023, told TechCrunch he conceived the idea while working on test-preparation courses for entry-level government jobs. He noticed that applicants included engineers, MBAs, and even PhDs. “I started speaking to these learners,” he said. “Some of them had paid fees to private colleges and spent 16 to 18 years earning those degrees.” Sinha said the gap has widened in recent years and could grow further as automation and new workplace tools change what employers expect from entry-level hires, while demand remains strong in credentialed roles such as healthcare, where hands-on training and staffing ratios still matter. “AI can cut down the administrative work of a nurse, such as filing patient details or electronic medical records,” Sinha stated. “But AI can’t replace a nurse if you still need one at an ICU for every two beds.” Emversity works with employers such as Fortis Healthcare, Apollo Hospitals, Aster, KIMS, IHCL (Taj Hotels), and Lemon Tree Hotels to co-design role-specific training modules, which it then helps universities embed into their degree programs. The startup does not charge employers, instead earning revenue through fees paid by partner institutions and through short-term certification programs run at its NSDC-affiliated skill centers. The startup operates with gross margins of about 80% and has kept customer acquisition costs below 10% of revenue by relying largely on organic channels rather than performance marketing, Sinha said. He added that the startup offers a career counseling platform for high school students that generated more than 350,000 inquiries and accounted for more than 20% of revenue last year. With the fresh funding, Emversity plans to expand its footprint to more than 200 locations over the next two years and deepen its focus on healthcare and hospitality, while entering new industries such as engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) and manufacturing. The startup is already in advanced discussions with one of India’s top EPC companies to design and roll out role-specific programs this year, and plans to begin manufacturing-focused training next year, Sinha said. To deliver consistent outcomes across campuses, Emversity combines employer-led curriculum design with hands-on training infrastructure, including simulation labs for clinical roles such as nursing and emergency care. Last year, Emversity’s revenue split roughly evenly between its university-embedded training programs and short-term certification courses run through its own skill centers, Sinha said. While Emversity currently builds talent pipelines for domestic employers, Sinha said the startup sees an opportunity to eventually serve international demand as well, particularly in healthcare, as aging populations in markets such as Japan and Germany look for trained workers. However, he did not disclose the exact timeline for catering to global demand. Emversity has about 700 employees, including 200 to 250 trainers deployed across its campus network."
Musk denies awareness of Grok sexual underage images as California AG launches probe,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/musk-denies-awareness-of-grok-sexual-underage-images-as-california-ag-launches-probe/,"Elon Musk said Wednesday he is “not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok,” hours before the California attorney general opened an investigation into xAI’s chatbot over the “proliferation of nonconsensual sexually explicit material.”  Musk’s denial comes as pressure mounts from governments worldwide — from the U.K. and Europe to Malaysia and Indonesia — after users on X began asking Grok to turn photos of real women, and in some cases children, into sexualized images without their consent. Copyleaks, an AI detection and content governance platform, estimated roughly one image was posted each minute on X. A separate sample gathered from January 5 to January 6 found 6,700 per hour over the 24-hour period. (X and xAI are part of the same company.)  “This material…has been used to harass people across the internet,” said California Attorney General Rob Bonta in a statement. “I urge xAI to take immediate action to ensure this goes no further.” The AG’s office will investigate whether and how xAI violated the law.  Several laws exist to protect targets of nonconsensual sexual imagery and child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Last year the Take It Down Act was signed into a federal law, which criminalizes knowingly distributing nonconsensual intimate images — including deepfakes — and requires platforms like X to remove such content within 48 hours. California also has its own series of laws that Gov. Gavin Newsom signed in 2024 to crack down on sexually explicit deepfakes. Grok began fulfilling user requests on X to produce sexualized photos of women and children toward the end of the year. The trend appears to have taken off after certain adult-content creators prompted Grok to generate sexualized imagery of themselves as a form of marketing, which then led to other users issuing similar prompts. In a number of public cases, including well-known figures like “Stranger Things” actress Millie Bobby Brown, Grok responded to prompts asking it to alter real photos of real women by changing clothing, body positioning, or physical features in overtly sexual ways. According to some reports, xAI has begun implementing safeguards to address the issue. Grok now requires a premium subscription before responding to certain image-generation requests, and even then the image may not be generated. April Kozen, VP of marketing at Copyleaks, told TechCrunch that Grok may fulfill a request in a more generic or toned-down way. They added that Grok appears more permissive with adult content creators.  “Overall, these behaviors suggest X is experimenting with multiple mechanisms to reduce or control problematic image generation, though inconsistencies remain,” Kozen said. Neither xAI nor Musk has publicly addressed the problem head on. A few days after the instances began, Musk appeared to make light of the issue by asking Grok to generate an image of himself in a bikini. On January 3, X’s safety account said the company takes “action against illegal content on X, including [CSAM],” without specifically addressing Grok’s apparent lack of safeguards or the creation of sexualized manipulated imagery involving women.  The positioning mirrors what Musk posted today, emphasizing illegality and user behavior. Musk wrote he was “not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok. Literally zero.” That statement doesn’t deny the existence of bikini pics or sexualized edits more broadly.  Michael Goodyear, an associate professor at New York Law School and former litigator, told TechCrunch that Musk likely narrowly focused on CSAM because the penalties for creating or distributing synthetic sexualized imagery of children are greater.  “For example, in the United States, the distributor or threatened distributor of CSAM can face up to three years imprisonment under the Take It Down Act, compared to two for nonconsensual adult sexual imagery,” Goodyear said.  He added that the “bigger point” is Musk’s attempt to draw attention to problematic user content. “Obviously, Grok does not spontaneously generate images. It does so only according to user request,” Musk wrote in his post. “When asked to generate images, it will refuse to produce anything illegal, as the operating principle for Grok is to obey the laws of any given country or state. There may be times when adversarial hacking of Grok prompts does something unexpected. If that happens, we fix the bug immediately.” Taken together, the post characterizes these incidents as uncommon, attributes them to user requests or adversarial prompting, and presents them as technical issues that can be solved through fixes. It stops short of acknowledging any shortcomings in Grok’s underlying safety design.  “Regulators may consider, with attention to free speech protections, requiring proactive measures by AI developers to prevent such content,” Goodyear said.  TechCrunch has reached out to xAI to ask how many times it caught instances of nonconsensual sexually manipulated images of women and children, what guardrails specifically changed, and whether the company notified regulators of the issue. TechCrunch will update the article if the company responds. The California AG isn’t the only regulator to try to hold xAI accountable for the issue. Indonesia and Malaysia have both temporarily blocked access to Grok; India has demanded that X make immediate technical and procedural changes to Grok; the European Commission ordered xAI to retain all documents related to its Grok chatbot, a precursor to opening a new investigation; and the U.K.’s online safety watchdog Ofcom opened a formal investigation under the U.K.’s Online Safety Act.  xAI has come under fire for Grok’s sexualized imagery before. As AG Bonta pointed out in a statement, Grok includes a “spicy mode” to generate explicit content. In October, an update made it even easier to jailbreak what little safety guidelines there were, resulting in many users creating hardcore pornography with Grok, as well as graphic and violent sexual images.  Many of the more pornographic images that Grok has produced have been of AI-generated people — something that many might still find ethically dubious but perhaps less harmful to the individuals in the images and videos. “When AI systems allow the manipulation of real people’s images without clear consent, the impact can be immediate and deeply personal,” Copyleaks co-founder and CEO Alon Yamin said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. “From Sora to Grok, we are seeing a rapid rise in AI capabilities for manipulated media. To that end, detection and governance are needed now more than ever to help prevent misuse.” "
"OpenAI signs deal, worth $10B, for compute from Cerebras",https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/openai-signs-deal-reportedly-worth-10-billion-for-compute-from-cerebras/,"OpenAI announced Wednesday that it had reached a multi-year agreement with AI chipmaker Cerebras. The chipmaker will deliver 750 megawatts of compute to the AI giant starting this year and continuing through the year 2028, Cerebras said. The deal is worth over $10 billion, a source familiar with the details told TechCrunch. Reuters also reported the deal size. Both companies said that the deal is about delivering faster outputs for OpenAI’s customers. In a blog post, OpenAI said these systems would speed responses that currently require more time to process. Andrew Feldman, co-founder and CEO of Cerebras, said just as “broadband transformed the internet, real-time inference will transform AI.” Cerebras has been around for over a decade but its star has risen significantly since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022 and the AI boom that followed. The company claims its systems, built with its chips designed for AI use, are faster than GPU-based systems (such as Nvidia’s offerings). Cerebras filed for an IPO in 2024 but since then has pushed it back a number of times. In the meantime, the company has continued to raise large amounts of money. On Tuesday, it was reported that the company was in talks to raise another billion dollars at a $22 billion valuation. It’s also worth noting that OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, is already an investor in the company and that OpenAI once considered acquiring it. “OpenAI’s compute strategy is to build a resilient portfolio that matches the right systems to the right workloads,” said Sachin Katti of OpenAI in the company’s post. “Cerebras adds a dedicated low-latency inference solution to our platform. That means faster responses, more natural interactions, and a stronger foundation to scale real-time AI to many more people.” "
The multibillion-dollar AI security problem enterprises can’t ignore ,https://techcrunch.com/podcast/the-multi-billion-ai-security-problem-enterprises-cant-ignore/,"AI agents are supposed to make work easier. But they’re also creating a whole new category of security nightmares.  As companies deploy AI-powered chatbots, agents, and copilots across their operations, they’re facing a new risk: How do you let employees and AI agents use powerful AI tools without accidentally leaking sensitive data, violating compliance rules, or opening the door to prompt-based injections? Witness AI just raised $58 million to find a solution, building what they call “the confidence layer for enterprise AI.”  Today on TechCrunch’s Equity podcast, Rebecca Bellan was joined by Barmak Meftah, co-founder and partner at Ballistic Ventures, and Rick Caccia, CEO of WitnessAI, to discuss what enterprises are actually worried about, why AI security will become an $800 billion to $1.2 trillion market by 2031, and what happens when AI agents start talking to other AI agents without human oversight.  Listen to the full episode to hear:   Subscribe to Equity on YouTube, Apple Podcasts, Overcast, Spotify, and all the casts.

AI models are starting to crack high-level math problems ,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/ai-models-are-starting-to-crack-high-level-math-problems/,"Over the weekend, Neel Somani, who is a software engineer, former quant researcher, and a startup founder, was testing the math skills of OpenAI’s new model when he made an unexpected discovery. After pasting the problem into ChatGPT and letting it think for 15 minutes, he came back to a full solution. He evaluated the proof and formalized it with a tool called Harmonic — but it all checked out.  “I was curious to establish a baseline for when LLMs are effectively able to solve open math problems compared to where they struggle,” Somani said. The surprise was that, using the latest model, the frontier started to push forward a bit.  ChatGPT’s chain of thought is even more impressive, rattling off mathematical axioms like Legendre’s formula, Bertrand’s postulate, and the Star of David theorum. Eventually, the model found a Math Overflow post from 2013, where Harvard mathematician Noam Elkies had given an elegant solution to a similar problem. But ChatGPT’s final proof differed from Elkies’ work in important ways, and gave a more complete solution to a version of the problem posed by legendary mathematician Paul Erdős, whose vast collection of unsolved problems has become a proving ground for AI. For anyone skeptical of machine intelligence, it’s a surprising result — and it’s not the only one. AI tools have become ubiquitous in mathematics, from formalization-oriented LLMs like Harmonic’s Aristotle to literature review tools like OpenAI’s deep research. But since the release of GPT 5.2 — which Somani describes as “anecdotally more skilled at mathematical reasoning than previous iterations” — the sheer volume of solved problems has become difficult to ignore, raising new questions about large language models’ ability to push the frontiers of human knowledge.   Somani was looking at the Erdős problems, a set of over 1,000 conjectures by the Hungarian mathematician that are maintained online. The problems have become a tempting target for AI-driven mathematics, varying significantly in both subject matter and difficulty. The first batch of autonomous solutions came in November from a Gemini-powered model called AlphaEvolve — but more recently, Somani and others have found GPT 5.2 to be remarkably adept with high-level math.   Since Christmas, 15 problems have been moved from “open” to “solved” on the Erdős website — and 11 of the solutions have specifically credited AI models as involved in the process.  The revered mathematician Terence Tao has a more nuanced look at the progress on his GitHub page, counting eight different problems where AI models made meaningful autonomous progress on an Erdős problem, with six other cases where progress was made by locating and building on previous research. It’s a long way from AI systems being able to do math without human intervention, but it’s clear that there’s an important role for large models to play.  On Mastodon, Tao conjectured that the scalable nature of AI systems makes them “better suited for being systematically applied to the ‘long tail’ of obscure Erdős problems, many of which actually have straightforward solutions.” “As such, many of these easier Erdős problems are now more likely to be solved by purely AI-based methods than by human or hybrid means,” Tao continued. Another driving force is a recent shift toward formalization, a labor-intensive task that makes mathematical reasoning easier to verify and extend. Formalization doesn’t require use of AI or even computers, but a new crop of automated tools have made the process far easier. The open source “proof assistant” Lean, which was developed at Microsoft Research in 2013, has become widely used within the field as a way of formalizing proof— and AI tools like Harmonic’s Aristotle promise to automate much of the work of formalization.  For Harmonic founder Tudor Achim, the sudden jump in solved Erdős problems is less important than the fact that the world’s greatest mathematicians are starting to take those tools seriously. “I care more about the fact that math and computer science professors are using [AI tools],” Achim said. “These people have reputations to protect, so when they’re saying they use Aristotle or they use ChatGPT, that’s real evidence.”  "
Google’s Trends Explore page gets new Gemini capabilities ,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/googles-trends-explore-page-gets-new-gemini-capabilities/,"Google announced Wednesday the launch of a revamped Trends Explore page, now featuring Gemini-powered capabilities that automatically identify and compare trends related to your searches. The update is rolling out on desktop starting today. The Trends Explore page has long served as a valuable tool for content creators, journalists, and researchers, making it easy to analyze search interest for any topic over time, across regions, and by category. The new Gemini experience streamlines much of the manual work involved in exploring trending topics, reducing research time, and surfacing connections that users might otherwise overlook. The redesigned Explore page now features a side panel that automatically identifies and compares relevant trends in your area of interest. Users will also see a list of suggested Gemini prompts to help with deeper exploration.  ​The page features a refreshed design, with dedicated icons and colors for each search term, making it easier to match them to their corresponding lines on the graph. Additionally, Google increased the number of terms users can compare and doubled the number of rising queries displayed on each timeline. A Google blog post uses trending dog breeds as an example to illustrate the new capabilities. The AI automatically populates the graph with up to eight search terms, such as “golden retriever” or “beagle.” It also suggests related topics like “hypoallergenic dog breeds” or “large dog breeds” for further exploration. Users can hover over a term to edit it or use filters for country, time, and property to customize the Trends timeline. ​This update is part of Google’s ongoing effort to embed Gemini into its core offerings. The company has already added AI capabilities to Search, Gmail, Maps, and Docs."
Robotics software maker Skild AI hits $14B valuation,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/robotic-software-maker-skild-ai-hits-14b-valuation/,"Skild AI, which makes foundation models for robots, seems to have more than tripled its valuation in just seven months. The startup has raised a $1.4 billion Series C round that values it at more than $14 billion, Bloomberg reported. The round was led by SoftBank, and Nvidia, Macquarie Group, 1789 Capital, and others also invested. Skild AI last raised funding at a $4.5 billion valuation this prior summer, Bloomberg reported. The company hasn’t disclosed the exact value of that round — it was rumored to be around $500 million — but Skild AI CEO Deepak Pathak told Bloomberg that the company has now raised more than $2 billion to date. TechCrunch has reached out to Skild AI for more information on its fundraising history, and we’ll update this piece when we hear more. Founded in 2023, Skild AI builds general-purpose robotic software and foundation models that can be retrofitted to a variety of different robots and tasks without requiring a ton of additional training. The hope is that these models can also learn from watching humans perform tasks. There has been a big push recently into this type of learn-as-you-go robotic software alongside the rising hype around humanoids. One of the biggest hurdles in robot adoption for both personal and industrial use cases is the sheer amount of training required for robots to learn each and every new task. Being able to learn and adapt as they go would clear the path for more robotic adoption. Field AI is another startup looking to build easily adapted robotic software. The maker of humanoid Neo, 1X, just released a world model in pursuit of the same goal."
"Gemini’s new beta feature provides proactive responses based on your photos, emails, and more",https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/geminis-new-beta-feature-provides-proactive-responses-based-on-your-photos-emails-and-more/,"Google announced on Wednesday that it’s launching a new beta feature in the Gemini app that allows the AI assistant to tailor its responses by connecting across your Google ecosystem, starting with Gmail, Photos, Search, and YouTube history. Although Gemini could already retrieve information from these apps, it can now reason across your data to provide proactive results, such as connecting a thread in your emails to a video you watched. Google says this means Gemini understands context without being told where to look. The tech giant notes that this beta experience, called Personal Intelligence, is off by default, as users have the option to choose if and when they want to connect their Google apps to Gemini. Of course, not everyone wants AI looking at their photos and YouTube history. If you do decide to connect your apps, Gemini will only use Personal Intelligence when it determines that doing so will be helpful, Google says. “Personal Intelligence has two core strengths: reasoning across complex sources and retrieving specific details from, say, an email or photo to answer your question,” wrote Josh Woodward, VP, Gemini app, Google Labs, and AI Studio, in a blog post. “It often combines these, working across text, photos and video to provide uniquely tailored answers.” Woodward shared an example of when he was standing in line at a tire shop and didn’t remember his car’s tire size. While most AI chatbots can determine a car’s tire size, Woodward says Gemini can go further by offering personalized responses. In his case, Gemini suggested all-weather tires after identifying family road trip photos in Google Photos. Woodward also said he forgot his license plate number, but Gemini was able to pull the number from a picture in Photos. “I’ve also been getting excellent tips for books, shows, clothes and travel,” Woodward wrote. “Just this week, it’s been exceptional for planning our upcoming spring break. By analyzing our family’s interests and past trips in Gmail and Photos, it skipped the tourist traps. Instead, it suggested an overnight train journey and specific board games we could play along the way.” Google says it has guardrails for sensitive topics, as Gemini will avoid making proactive assumptions about sensitive data like health. However, the tech giant also notes that Gemini will discuss this data if you ask it to. Additionally, Gemini doesn’t train directly on your Gmail inbox or Google Photos library. Instead, it trains on specific prompts in Gemini and the model’s responses. In the examples above, the photos of the road trip, the license plate picture in Photos, and the emails in Gmail are not directly used to train the model. They are only referenced to generate a response, Google says. Personal Intelligence is rolling out to Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers in the U.S. Google plans to expand the feature to more countries and Gemini’s free tier.  Google provided a list of example prompts to try, including “Help me plan my weekend in [city i.e. New York] based on things I like to do,” “Recommend some documentaries based on what I’ve been curious about,” or “Based on my delivery and grocery receipts in Gmail, Search history, and YouTube watch history, recommend 5 YouTube channels that match my cooking style or meal prep vibe.”"
"AI security firm, depthfirst, announces $40 million Series A",https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/ai-security-firm-depthfirst-announces-40-million-series-a/,"Cybercriminals are increasingly using AI in their attacks. At the same time, cyber defenders are also turning to the technology to fight back. Depthfirst, a security startup positioning itself at the forefront of this AI-powered defense, announced Wednesday that it had raised $40 million in a Series A round. Founded in October 2024, the company raised the round from Accel Partners, which led the investment, with participation from SV Angel, Mantis VC, and Alt Capital. Depthfirst offers a platform called General Security Intelligence, an AI-native suite that helps companies scan and analyze their codebases and workflows for signs of trouble. The company says that the platform also allows companies to protect themselves from credential exposures and to monitor threats to their open source and third-party components. The company plans to use the new capital to hire additional staff for applied research and engineering, as well as product and sales.  “We’ve entered an era where software is written faster than it can be secured,” said Qasim Mithani, the company’s co-founder and CEO, as part of the announcement. Mithani, who previously worked for Databricks and Amazon, added that automation has changed how bad actors execute their attacks. “AI has already changed how attackers work. Defense has to evolve just as fundamentally.” The company’s leadership comes with backgrounds in both AI and security. One of depthfirst’s other co-founders, Daniele Perito, previously served as director of security and risk engineering at Square, which is part of Jack Dorsey’s Block. Its CTO (and another co-founder), Andrea Michi, was previously an engineer at Google DeepMind. Just as AI can be used for legitimate purposes, it can also be used by cybercriminals to automate a whole range of malicious processes — from writing malware to social engineering attacks to scanning for vulnerabilities to exploit. Last November, Anthropic claimed that it had thwarted the first “AI orchestrated cyber espionage campaign.” Depthfirst says it can help protect companies from many of these “AI-driven exploits,” and that it has already developed partnerships with a number of prominent companies, including AngelList, Lovable, and Moveworks.

VoiceRun nabs $5.5M to build a voice agent factory,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/voicerun-nabs-5-5m-to-build-voice-agent-factory/,"Nicholas Leonard and Derek Caneja wanted to build AI voice agents, but when they went to build the product, they felt many of these voice agents had design flaws.  Some of these agents were being built with no-code tools, meaning shipping to production was fast, but the quality of the product was often low. Other agents were being made by companies that had the time and resources to spend months building specialized tools. “Developers and enterprises needed an alternative,” Leonard told TechCrunch, adding that he and Caneja also realized that the future of software would be “coded, validated, and optimized by coding agents.”  “These two insights and a historical realization gave us the inspiration for VoiceRun,” Leonard, the company’s CEO, said. Caneja is the company’s CTO.  Last year, they decided to launch VoiceRun, a platform that lets developers and coding assistants launch and scale voice agents. Right now, many of these low-code platforms let people build voice agents with visual diagrams, where people click through conversation flows and write prompts into boxes that then dictate how the agent should behave. All of that can be hard to manage, Leonard said.  VoiceRun, on the other hand, lets users code how they want their voice agents to behave, giving them more flexibility in creating the product they want. Code is the native language of coding agents, Leonard explained. “They are going to do a far better job operating in code than in a visual interface,” Leonard said. Furthermore, with visuals, there are limited configuration options, so if someone wanted to build a voice agent that could speak in a different dialect, it might be harder to do if the maker of the visual interface didn’t build a feature that can handle that task. “But in code, it’s incredibly simple to do,” he said. “There is a long tail of millions of examples of little things you might want to do that aren’t supported by the visual interface.”  Aside from coding agents, VoiceRun also lets users perform A/B testing and deploy instantly with one click.  The company is geared toward enterprise developers, helping companies, for example, incorporate AI into their customer services, or helping tech companies launch voice-based products. He mentioned working with a restaurant-tech company launching an AI phone concierge for food reservations. The company announced on Wednesday the closing of a $5.5 million seed round led by Flybridge Capital.  There is a lot of competition in the AI agent space. Startups in this area last year nabbed billions of dollars (out of the many billions that flooded into AI companies in general). Leonard feels his company is up against two ends of the market: There are the no-code voice builders, like Bland and Retell AI, he said, that let users build quick demos. There are also more sophisticated tools, like LiveKit and Pipecat, which give developers “maximum control.” He feels VoiceRun sits in the middle of these two ends.  “​​We provide global voice infrastructure and an evaluation-driven lifecycle, while keeping ownership of business logic code and data in the customers’ hands,” he said. “The key difference is that we are closing the loop for end-to-end coding agent development. We expect developers to be supervising coding agents that write code, run tests, deploy, and propose improvements.”  In some ways, Leonard is hoping his product helps developers create voice agent tools that will, in turn, help people feel more comfortable with automated voices. Customers today “feel relief” when a human answers the phone, “because voice automation has been brittle and ineffective.”  A survey from Five9 last year showed that three-fourths of its survey respondents still prefer talking to a human when it comes to customer service matters. Leonard said he wants to change this perception because “human agents today have their own limitations,” like language barriers or making people feel judged.  “There were great cars before the Model T, but vehicles didn’t become ubiquitous until the assembly line,” Leonard said. “There are great voice agents today, but they won’t be ubiquitous until the voice agent factory is built. VoiceRun is that factory.” "
Microsoft announces glut of new data centers but says it won’t let your electricity bill go up,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/microsoft-announces-glut-of-new-data-centers-but-says-it-wont-let-your-electricity-bill-go-up/,"Although public backlash against data centers has been intense over the past 12 months, all of the tech industry’s biggest companies have promised additional buildouts of AI infrastructure in the coming year. That includes OpenAI partner Microsoft, which, on Tuesday, announced what it calls a “community-first” approach to AI Infrastructure. Microsoft’s announcement, which comes only a day after Mark Zuckerberg said that Meta would launch its own AI infrastructure program, isn’t unexpected. Last year, the company announced that it planned to spend billions to expand its AI capacity. What is a little unusual are the promises the company has now made about how it will handle that buildout. On Tuesday, Microsoft promised to take the “steps needed to be a good neighbor in the communities where we build, own, and operate our data centers.” That includes, according to the company, its plans to “pay its own way” to ensure that local electricity bills don’t go through the roof in the places where it builds. Specifically, the company says it will work with local utility companies to ensure that the rates it pays cover its full share of its burden on the local grid. “We will work closely with utility companies that set electricity prices and state commissions that approve these prices,” Microsoft said. “Our goal is straightforward: to ensure that the electricity cost of serving our data centers is not passed on to residential customers.” The company has also promised to create jobs in the communities where it touches down, as well as to minimize the amount of water that its centers need to function. Water usage by data centers has obviously been a contentious topic, with data centers accused of creating substantial issues for local water supplies and spurring other environmental concerns. The jobs promise is also relevant, given lingering questions around the number of both short-term and permanent jobs that such projects typically create. It’s pretty clear why Microsoft feels it is necessary to make these promises right now. Data center construction has become a political flashpoint in recent years, generating intense backlash and protest from local communities. Data Center Watch, an organization that tracks anti-data center activism, has observed that there are as many as 142 different activist groups across 24 states currently organizing against such developments. This backlash has already impacted Microsoft directly. In October, the company abandoned plans for a new data center in Caledonia, Wisconsin, after “community feedback” was overwhelmingly negative. In Michigan, meanwhile, the company’s plans for a similar project in a small central township have recently inspired locals to take to the streets in protest. On Tuesday, around the same time Microsoft announced its “good neighbor” pledge, an op-ed in an Ohio newspaper (where Microsoft is currently developing several data center campuses) excoriated the company, blaming it and its peers for climate change. Concerns have extended even to the White House, where an AI buildout has become one of the major tenets of the Trump administration. On Monday, President Trump took to social media to promise that Microsoft specifically would make “major changes” to ensure that Americans’ electricity bills wouldn’t rise. Trump said the changes would “ensure that Americans don’t ‘pick up the tab’ for their power consumption.” In short, by now, Microsoft understands that it’s fighting a tide of negative public opinion. It remains to be seen whether the company’s new assurances of jobs, environmental stewardship, and low electricity bills will be enough to turn the tide. "
A consumer watchdog issued a warning about Google’s AI agent shopping protocol — Google says she’s wrong,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/a-consumer-watchdog-issued-a-warning-about-googles-ai-agent-shopping-protocol-google-says-shes-wrong/,"Shortly after Google announced its new Universal Commerce Protocol for AI-powered shopping agents, a consumer economics watchdog sounded the alarm. In a now viral post on X viewed nearly 400,000 times, Lindsay Owens on Sunday wrote, “Big/bad news for consumers. Google is out today with an announcement of how they plan to integrate shopping into their AI offerings including search and Gemini. The plan includes ‘personalized upselling.’ I.e. Analyzing your chat data and using it to overcharge you.” Owens is executive director of the consumer economics think tank Groundwork Collaborative. Her concern stems from looking at Google’s roadmap, as well as delving into some of its detailed specification docs. The roadmap includes a feature that will support “upselling,” which could help merchants promote more expensive items to AI shopping agents. She also called out Google’s plans to adjust prices for programs like new-member discounts or loyalty-based pricing, which Google CEO Sundar Pichai described when he announced the new protocol at the National Retail Federation conference. After TechCrunch inquired about Owens’ allegations, Google both publicly responded on X and spoke with TechCrunch directly to reject the validity of her concerns. In a post on X, Google responded that, “These claims around pricing are inaccurate. We strictly prohibit merchants from showing prices on Google that are higher than what is reflected on their site, period. 1/ The term “upselling” is not about overcharging. It’s a standard way for retailers to show additional premium product options that people might be interested in. The choice is always with the user on what to buy. 2/ “Direct Offers” is a pilot that enables merchants to offer a *lower* priced deal or add extra services like free shipping — it cannot be used to raise prices.” In a separate conversation with TechCrunch, a Google spokesperson said that Google’s Business Agent does not have functionality that would allow it to change a retailer’s pricing based on individual data. Owens also pointed out that Google’s technical documents on handling a shopper’s identity say that: “The scope complexity should be hidden in the consent screen shown to the user.” The Google spokesperson told TechCrunch that this is not about hiding what the user is agreeing to, but consolidating actions (get, create, update, delete, cancel, complete) instead making a user agree to each one separately. Even if Owens’ concerns about this particular protocol are a nothingburger as Google asserts, her general premise is still worth some thought. She is warning that shopping agents built by Big Tech could one day allow merchants to customize pricing based on what they think you are willing to pay after analyzing your AI chats and shopping patterns. This is instead of charging the same price to everyone. She calls it “surveillance pricing.” Although Google says its agents can’t do such a thing now, it’s also true that Google is, at its heart, an advertising company serving brands and merchants. Last year, a federal court ordered Google to change a number of search business practices after ruling the company was engaged in anticompetitive behavior. While many of us are excited to welcome a world where we’d have a team of AI agents handling pesky tasks for us (rescheduling doctor’s appointments, researching replacement mini-blinds), it doesn’t take a clairvoyant to see the kinds of abuse that will be possible. The problem is that the big tech companies that are in the best position to build agentic shopping tools also have the most mixed incentives. Their business rests on serving the sellers and harvesting data on consumers. That means AI-powered shopping could be a big opportunity for startups building independent tech. We’re seeing the first few sprinkles of AI-powered possibilities. Startups like Dupe, which uses natural language queries to help people find affordable furniture, and Beni, which uses images and text for thrifting fashion, are early entrants in this space. Until then, the old adage probably holds true: buyer beware.   "
Ring founder details the camera company’s ‘intelligent assistant’ era,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/ring-founder-details-the-camera-companys-intelligent-assistant-era/,"What does it take to bring a burned-out founder back to the company he sold to Amazon? For Jamie Siminoff of the video doorbell maker Ring, it was the potential of AI — and the Palisades fires that destroyed his garage, the birthplace of Ring itself. Siminoff’s vision: turn Ring from a video doorbell company into an AI-powered “intelligent assistant” for the entire home and beyond. A handful of new features that advance that goal shipped just ahead of this year’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, including fire alerts, alerts about “unusual events,” conversational AI, facial recognition features, and more. Some of these additions have not been without controversy, as consumers have to grapple with how much privacy they’re giving up in favor of convenience and security. But together, they point to Ring’s latest phase of its business. “Turn AI backwards — it’s IA, it’s an intelligent assistant,” Siminoff explained in a conversation at CES last week. “We keep doing these things together that are making us smarter, and making it so that, for you, there’s less cognitive load.” By 2023, five years after selling Ring to Amazon, Siminoff had been running at full throttle for so long that he needed out. “I built the company in my garage…I was there for all of it. We then get to Amazon, and I go even faster — like, more throttle,” Siminoff told TechCrunch. “I didn’t get to Amazon and say, ‘I’m an exited entrepreneur, I’ll just chill out,’” he adds. “I blasted the f**king gas.” When he later decided to depart the retail giant, he said it was because it felt like the time was right — Ring had delivered its products and was profitable. AI’s advances soon had him rethinking his plans. Though Siminoff could have done anything, he wasn’t motivated to start something new because the things he was most excited about were those he wanted to build on Ring’s platform. “AI comes out, and you realize, ‘Oh my God, there’s so much we could do,’” Siminoff said. “And then the fires happened,” he adds, referring to the devastating Palisades Fires that impacted Siminoff’s neighbors and burned the back of his house, destroying the garage where Ring was built. One of Ring’s new additions, Fire Watch, was inspired by this tragedy. In partnership with the nonprofit fire monitoring organization Watch Duty, Ring customers will be able to opt in to share footage when a massive fire event happens, allowing the organization to build a better map that can be used to help deploy firefighting resources more efficiently. The AI will be used in that case to look for smoke, fire, embers, and more in the shared footage. Another recently launched AI feature, Search Party, also aims to solve real-world problems as it helps people find their lost pets. That feature is now reuniting one family per day with their dogs — a rate higher than Siminoff expected. “I had hoped to find one dog by the end of Q1…that was my goal. No one’s ever done anything remotely like this, and I just didn’t know how the AI would work,” he admits. The AI, a sort of “facial recognition for dogs,” tries matching a posted image of a lost pet with Ring footage, which users opt into sharing if they get an alert about a possible match. Other moves, however, have raised concerns, particularly those that saw the company forging deals with law enforcement. In 2024, Ring ended an earlier set of police partnerships that allowed police to request footage from Ring owners after some customer backlash. But this year, the company moved forward with new deals with companies like Flock Safety and Axon, which reintroduced tools that again allow law enforcement to request images and videos from Ring’s customers. Siminoff defends the company’s decisions in this space, saying that customers can choose whether or not they want to share their Ring footage. “The requesting agency doesn’t even know that they asked you,” he says. That is, if police are looking for someone who’s been breaking into cars in a certain geographic area, the alert will go out, and customers can respond if they choose. If customers decline, it’s anonymous. He also points to the Brown University shooting in December. A combination of surveillance cameras — including Ring’s, Siminoff claims, helped to find the mass shooter. “Scrutiny is fine…I welcome it, but I’m glad that we stood up to it, because in the Brown shooting, the police needed this,” the founder says. “If we had caved to people’s ‘maybe’s,’ and the scrutiny that they were giving us — [that] I don’t think is correct — the police wouldn’t have had a tool to try to help find this [shooter], and the community would not have had the ability to as easily share in what was happening and as fast.” Despite the successful capture of the shooting suspect, there are still worries about what the mounting collection of data from private customers means for the landscape of the country. Plus, some are concerned that the data could be misused to go after anyone the government decides to target. Another AI feature, “Familiar Faces,” has also received pushback from the consumer protection organization EFF, along with a U.S. senator. The facial recognition feature uses AI to allow Ring to identify and store the faces of people who come in and out of the home on a regular basis, including their names, if provided. This way, you could get an alert that “mom” is at the front door, or that the babysitter arrived, or the kids are home from school, for instance. The feature could also be used to help disable alerts about people whose comings and goings don’t need to be watched closely. Siminoff defends this, too, as a way for Ring to become more personalized to its users and customize the software to adapt to the unique “fingerprint” of their house. That way, the customer has to interact less with Ring’s products, unless it’s something that requires attention. He argues that this addition builds on trust with Ring’s customers, rather than undermining it. “Our products will not be on neighbors’ houses if they don’t trust us….There’s no incentive for us to do something that would lose trust with our neighbors in maintaining their privacy,” Siminoff says. “Anyone — and I would respect it — would take their camera off of their home if they felt like we were violating their privacy.” But with Ring’s expansion into commercial camera systems, including mounted cameras, a line of sensors, and a solar-powered trailer, also introduced just ahead of CES, the company’s customer base won’t just be neighbors protecting their homes but also businesses, job sites, campuses, festivals, parking lots, and everywhere else.

Doctors think AI has a place in healthcare — but maybe not as a chatbot,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/doctors-think-ai-has-a-place-in-healthcare-but-maybe-not-as-a-chatbot/,"Dr. Sina Bari, a practicing surgeon and AI healthcare leader at data company iMerit, has seen firsthand how ChatGPT can lead patients astray with faulty medical advice. “I recently had a patient come in, and when I recommended a medication, they had a dialogue printed out from ChatGPT that said this medication has a 45% chance of pulmonary embolism,” Dr. Bari told TechCrunch.  When Dr. Bari investigated further, he found that the statistic was from a paper about the impact of that medication in a niche subgroup of people with tuberculosis, which didn’t apply to his patient.  And yet, when OpenAI announced its dedicated ChatGPT Health chatbot last week, Dr. Bari felt more excitement than concern. ChatGPT Health, which will roll out in the coming weeks, allows users to talk to the chatbot about their health in a more private setting, where their messages won’t be used as training data for the underlying AI model. “I think it’s great,” Dr. Bari said. “It is something that’s already happening, so formalizing it so as to protect patient information and put some safeguards around it […] is going to make it all the more powerful for patients to use.” Users can get more personalized guidance from ChatGPT Health by uploading their medical records and syncing with apps like Apple Health and MyFitnessPal. For the security-minded, this raises immediate red flags.  “All of a sudden there’s medical data transferring from HIPAA-compliant organizations to non-HIPAA-compliant vendors,” Itai Schwartz, co-founder of data loss prevention firm MIND, told TechCrunch. “So I’m curious to see how the regulators would approach this.” But the way some industry professionals see it, the cat is already out of the bag. Now, instead of Googling cold symptoms, people are talking to AI chatbots — over 230 million people already talk to ChatGPT about their health each week.  “This was one of the biggest use cases of ChatGPT,” Andrew Brackin, a partner at Gradient who invests in health tech, told TechCrunch. “So it makes a lot of sense that they would want to build a more kind of private, secure, optimized version of ChatGPT for these healthcare questions.” AI chatbots have a persistent problem with hallucinations, a particularly sensitive issue in healthcare. According to Vectara’s Factual Consistency Evaluation Model, OpenAI’s GPT-5 is more prone to hallucinations than many Google and Anthropic models. But AI companies see the potential to rectify inefficiencies in the healthcare space (Anthropic also announced a health product this week). For Dr. Nigam Shah, a professor of medicine at Stanford, chief data scientist for Stanford Health Care, and co-founder of Atropos Health, the inability of American patients to access care is more urgent than the threat of ChatGPT dispensing poor advice. “Right now, you go to any health system and you want to meet the primary care doctor — the wait time will be three to six months,” Dr. Shah said. “If your choice is to wait six months for a real doctor, or talk to something that is not a doctor but can do some things for you, which would you pick?” Dr. Shah thinks a clearer route to introduce AI into healthcare systems comes on the provider side, rather than the patient side.  Medical journals have often reported that administrative tasks can consume about half of a primary care physician’s time, which slashes the number of patients they can see in a given day. If that kind of work could be automated, doctors would be able to see more patients, perhaps reducing the need for people to use tools like ChatGPT Health without additional input from a real doctor. Dr. Shah leads a team at Stanford that is developing ChatEHR, a software that is built into the electronic health record (EHR) system, allowing clinicians to interact with a patient’s medical records in a more streamlined, efficient manner. “Making the electronic medical record more user friendly means physicians can spend less time scouring every nook and cranny of it for the information they need,” Dr. Sneha Jain, an early tester of ChatEHR, said in a Stanford Medicine article. “ChatEHR can help them get that information up front so they can spend time on what matters — talking to patients and figuring out what’s going on.”  Anthropic is also working on AI products that can be used on the clinician and insurer sides, rather than just its public-facing Claude chatbot. This week, Anthropic announced Claude for Healthcare by explaining how it could be used to reduce the time spent on tedious administrative tasks, like submitting prior authorization requests to insurance providers. “Some of you see hundreds, thousands of these prior authorization cases a week,” said Anthropic CPO Mike Krieger in a recent presentation at J.P. Morgan’s Healthcare Conference. “So imagine cutting 20, 30 minutes out of each of them — it’s a dramatic time savings.” As AI and medicine become more intertwined, there’s an inescapable tension between the two worlds — a doctor’s primary incentive is to help their patients, while tech companies are ultimately accountable to their shareholders, even if their intentions are noble. “I think that tension is an important one,” Dr. Bari said. “Patients rely on us to be cynical and conservative in order to protect them.”"
Neo humanoid maker 1X releases world model to help bots learn what they see,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/neo-humanoid-maker-1x-releases-world-model-to-help-bots-learn-what-they-see/,"The robotics company behind the Neo humanoid robot, 1X, has unveiled a new AI model that it says understands the dynamics of the real world and can help bots learn new information on their own. This physics-based model, called 1X World Model, uses a combination of video and prompts to give Neo robots new abilities. The video allows Neo robots to learn new tasks they weren’t previously trained on, according to 1X. This release comes as 1X is gearing up to release its Neo humanoids into the home. The company opened up preorders for its humanoids in October with plans to ship the bots this year. A 1X spokesperson declined to share a timeline of when these bots were shipping or share any information regarding how many have been ordered beyond saying preorders exceeded expectations. “After years of developing our world model and making Neo’s design as close to human as possible, Neo can now learn from internet-scale video and apply that knowledge directly to the physical world,” Bernt Børnich, founder and CEO of 1X said in a statement. “With the ability to transform any prompt into new actions — even without prior examples — this marks the starting point of Neo’s ability to teach itself to master nearly anything you could think to ask.” Saying that the bot can transform any prompt into a new action is a lofty claim and not entirely accurate; you can’t tell a Neo to drive a car and it will suddenly know how to parallel park, for instance. But there is some learning going on. A 1X spokesperson clarified that this world model allows the bots to attempt anything. But what the bots have actually been able to learn from this model remains limited to basic tasks such as removing an air fryer basket, putting toast in a toaster, and giving a high five, among other similar tasks. This ability to learn these small tasks is the first step for these bots to eventually learn more complicated actions. This world model also gives the company insight into how Neo is thinking of behaving or reacting to a certain prompt which offers useful data for future training. This story was updated on 1/14/2026 to better explain how the world model works. "
ElevenLabs CEO says the voice AI startup crossed $330M ARR last year,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/elevenlabs-ceo-says-the-voice-ai-startup-crossed-330-million-arr-last-year/,"ElevenLabs, the AI voice-generation startup, crossed $330 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), CEO Mati Staniszewski said in an interview with Bloomberg. “Really, what this [growth in ARR] shows is that trajectory across the company. We started the company in 2022 and launched the first product in 2023. It took us 20 months to reach $100 million in ARR, 10 months to reach $200 million, and five months to reach the current number,” he said. Staniszewski mentioned that both Fortune 500 companies and startups are adopting its voice agent technology, which uses company data and knowledge bases to power customer support and customer experience interactions. In a separate post on X, the company noted that enterprises have deployed its technology to handle more than 50,000 calls per month. The startup raised $180 million in Series C funding co-led by a16z and ICONIQ at a $3.3 billion valuation in January 2025. It then doubled its valuation months later when ICONIQ and another earlier investor, Sequoia, shelled out another $100 million to snap up employee shares. Besides providing models for voice generation and voice agents, the company launched music creation capabilities last year and also struck a deal with celebrities such as Michael Caine and Matthew McConaughey to use their voices for AI-generated content.

The tech giant notes that Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Motion, Compressor, and MainStage will continue to be available as one-time purchases on the Mac App Store, while free versions of Numbers, Pages, Keynote, and Freeform will remain available."
Deepgram raises $130M at $1.3B valuation and buys a YC AI startup,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/deepgram-raises-130m-at-1-3b-valuation-and-buys-a-yc-ai-startup/,"Usage of voice AI in sales, marketing, customer support, and consumer applications has shot up in the last few years. As a result, model providers have seen increased business, along with investor interest. On the back of this demand, today, Deepgram said that it has raised $130 million in a Series C round led by AVP at a $1.3 billion valuation. The round also saw existing investors such as Alkeon, In-Q-Tel, Madrona, Tiger, Wing, and Y Combinator put in more money. Plus, new investors like Alumni Ventures, Columbia University, Princeville Capital, Twilio, and SAP joined the round. The company has raised over $215 million in funding to date. The startup’s raise continues the trend of sizable funding rounds in voice AI last year, including Sesame’s $250 million Series B, ElevenLab’s $180 million Series C, and Gradium’s $70 million seed round. Elizabeth de Saint-Aignan, a partner at AVP, told TechCrunch that when the fund was talking to enterprises about how they were using AI, voice came up frequently, and it started looking into companies working in this area. “In 2024, when we were talking to enterprises about how they were thinking about using AI inside their business, we started to hear about them using voice AI in processes like contact centers and sales developments. When we chatted with them more, we realized a lot of voice AI tech was powered by Deepgram, and that’s what led us to them [Deepgram],” de Saint-Aignan said. She noted that voice AI could help in making customers’ interactions with enterprises more pleasant while reducing costs for companies, and Deepgram could play a central part in it. Deepgram has a bunch of models related to text-to-speech and speech-to-text, along with platforms and APIs for conversational speech recognition and interruption handling with low latency. It noted that more than 1,300 organizations use its voice AI products and models, including meeting notetaker Granola, voice agent startup Vapi, and Twilio. The company’s CEO, Scott Stephenson, said that the company didn’t need the fundraise and it was cashflow positive last year. “In the last year, voice AI has gone mainstream, and there is more potential pull. We see that we can make larger investment sooner in order to accelerate growth. And that is why we felt it could be a good time to raise,” he said. “We weren’t out looking for a raise, though. We had multiple people coming to us. We wanted strategic investors who understand voice AI and the technical intricacies of it and have relationships with companies building using the technology.” The company wants to use the new fundraising to expand its global footprint and better support multiple languages. It is also focusing on catering to restaurants through voice AI. To that end, it has acquired Y Combinator-backed OfOne, which built a voice AI-powered solution for quick-service restaurants. The startup claims that it has more than 93% accuracy in receiving orders. Voice AI has had its challenges in the restaurant space. Last year, Taco Bell withdrew its voice AI experiment after a person ordered 18,000 water cups. “I am excited about this [voice AI-driven food ordering] because food ordering might be the first positive interaction more than 300 million Americans have with voice AI. There have been a lot of sour interactions with voice AI over the last 20 years, where a lot of assistants have come out, and people felt that those didn’t provide a magical experience. But when you can order your food using natural conversation, people would think the technology is ready,” Stephenson said. There seems to be investor interest in the sector, as OfOne’s acquisition news comes after Presto, which serves brands like Carl’s Jr., picked up $10 million in new funding. Analysts’ reports peg the voice market to grow at over 30% year-over-year and become a $14-$20 billion market by 2030. With this growth rate, model and API providers will look to be multibillion-dollar companies by becoming a core component for enterprises and startups developing voice solutions. "
Slackbot is an AI agent now,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/slackbot-is-an-ai-agent-now/,"Slackbot, the automated assistant baked into the Salesforce-owned corporate messaging platform Slack, is entering a new era as an AI agent. And Salesforce CTO Parker Harris hopes it will be as viral as OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The cloud software giant rolled out the new version of Slackbot on Tuesday. This new AI agent version of Slackbot, which is generally available for Business+ and Enterprise+ customers, can find information, draft emails, and schedule meetings, among other things, all within the Slack platform, according to the company. It can also connect to, and interact with, other enterprise products like Microsoft Teams and Google Drive to find information if it’s granted permission. This allows users to work across a handful of different common enterprise applications without leaving Slack. Salesforce, and its enterprise software competitors, are pouring resources into the development of AI products in a bid to preserve, and even grow, their market share. The remodeled Slackbot, which was originally announced at Salesforce’s annual Dreamforce conference in October, is just one piece of Salesforce’s enterprise AI-heavy product plan. Harris told TechCrunch the next-gen Slackbot is completely different than what existed before; the company kept the name because it is already well known. Harris added that Slack doesn’t generally release new features. Instead, Slack typically issues updates to the product to help drive adoption, which makes Slackbot quite different from past product updates. “It is an agent, it is a super agent that is your employee agent,” Harris said. “It’s powered by generative AI, and it is something that is highly crafted and highly curated to be an agentic experience that employees and users love.” Salesforce tests new products, like Slackbot, with its employees for months before they release them — Harris joked they like to drink their own champagne first. Slackbot has been the most adopted internal tool they’ve released, he said. “Just seeing the sheer active user count is a great sign we have hit on product-market-fit,” Harris said about internal adoption. “Adopted, not mandated, in corporations.” This is just the beginning of Slackbot’s second bloom as an AI agent, Harris said. In the future, they want Slackbot to move beyond just a text-based agent only in Slack. He said they want to add voice capabilities in the future and the ability for Slackbot to browse the internet alongside its users. “I am very confident that investing in Slackbot is not only good for Slack, it will be incredibly good for the entire company,” Harris said."
Brazil orders Meta to suspend policy banning third-party AI chatbots from WhatsApp,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/brazil-orders-meta-to-suspend-policy-banning-third-party-ai-chatbots-from-whatsapp/,"Brazil’s competition watchdog has ordered WhatsApp to put on hold its policy that bars third-party AI companies from using its business API to offer chatbots on the app. The agency has also started an investigation against the company to determine if the policy is anti-competitive. “According to the investigations, there is possible anti-competitive conduct of an exclusive nature that arises from the application of the New WhatsApp Terms (“WhatsApp Business Solution Terms”) imposed by Meta to regulate the access and offer, by providers of artificial intelligence tools, of its technologies to WhatsApp users,” the Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econômica (CADE) said. CADE said it would investigate if Meta’s terms are exclusionary to competitors and unduly favor Meta AI, the company’s chatbot that’s offered on WhatsApp. Meta last October changed its terms of use for the WhatsApp Business API to ban third-party AI companies from offering their chatbots on the app. Companies like OpenAI, Perplexity, and Microsoft soon after noted that after the policy goes into force from January 15, their chatbots would no longer be offered on WhatsApp. Notably, Meta’s policy does not stop businesses from offering their own chatbots, AI-powered or otherwise, within WhatsApp to their customers. CADE’s investigation comes after the European Union launched its own antitrust investigation into the new policy, as has Italy. If the EU finds Meta in breach of its antitrust rules, it could be fined up to 10% of its global revenue. Meta has told AI providers that they can continue offering their AI chatbots to users in Italy even after the new rules go into force on January 15, according to a notice to developers seen by TechCrunch. The company could make a similar decision in Brazil following CADE’s order. Meta did not immediately respond to a request for a comment outside regular business hours. The company has consistently maintained that AI chatbots are straining its systems that were designed for different uses of its business API. Meta has even said in the past that people who want to use different chatbots can do so outside WhatsApp. “The purpose of the WhatsApp Business API is to help businesses provide customer support and send relevant updates. Our focus is on supporting the tens of thousands of businesses who are building these experiences on WhatsApp,” a Meta spokesperson said when the company changed the terms in October."
"Converge Bio raises $25M, backed by Bessemer and execs from Meta, OpenAI, Wiz",https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/13/ai-drug-discovery-startup-converge-bio-pulls-in-25m-from-bessemer-and-execs-from-meta-openai-and-wiz/,"Artificial intelligence is moving quickly into drug discovery as pharmaceutical and biotech companies look for ways to cut years off R&D timelines and increase the chances of success amid rising costs. More than 200 startups are now competing to weave AI directly into research workflows, attracting growing interest from investors. Converge Bio is the latest company to ride that shift, securing new capital as competition in the AI-driven drug discovery space heats up. The Boston- and Tel Aviv-based startup, which helps pharma and biotech companies develop drugs faster using generative AI trained on molecular data, has raised a $25 million oversubscribed Series A round, led by Bessemer Venture Partners. TLV Partners, Saras Capital, and Vintage Investment Partners also joined the round, along with additional backing from unidentified executives at Meta, OpenAI, and Wiz. In practice, Converge trains generative models on DNA, RNA, and protein sequences, then plugs them into pharma and biotech’s workflows to speed up drug development. “The drug-development lifecycle has defined stages — from target identification and discovery to manufacturing, clinical trials, and beyond — and within each, there are experiments we can support,” Converge Bio CEO and co-founder Dov Gertz said in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch. “Our platform continues to expand across these stages, helping bring new drugs to market faster.” So far, Converge has rolled out customer-facing systems. The startup has already introduced three discrete AI systems: one for antibody design, one for protein yield optimization, and one for biomarker and target discovery. “Take our antibody design system as an example. It’s not just a single model. It’s made up of three integrated components. First, a generative model creates novel antibodies. Next, predictive models filter those antibodies based on their molecular properties. Finally, a docking system, which uses a physics-based model, simulates the three-dimensional interactions between the antibody and its target,” Gertz continued. The value lies in the system as a whole, not any single model, according to the CEO. “Our customers don’t have to piece models together themselves. They get ready-to-use systems that plug directly into their workflows.” The new funding comes about a year and a half after the company raised a $5.5 million seed round in 2024.   Since then, the two-year-old startup has scaled quickly. Converge has completed over 40 programs with more than a dozen pharmaceutical and biotech customers, Gertz said. It works with customers across the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Israel and is now expanding into Asia. The team has also grown rapidly, increasing to 34 employees from just nine in November 2024. Along the way, Converge has begun publishing public case studies. In one, the startup helped a partner boost protein yield by 4 to 4.5X in a single computational iteration. In another, the platform generated antibodies with extremely high binding affinity, reaching the single-nanomolar range, Gertz noted. AI-driven drug discovery is experiencing a surge of interest. Last year, Eli Lilly teamed up with Nvidia to build what the companies called the pharma industry’s most powerful supercomputer for drug discovery. And in October 2024, the developers behind Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold project won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for creating AlphaFold, the AI system that can predict protein structures. When asked about the momentum and how it is shaping Converge Bio’s growth, Gertz said that the company is witnessing the largest financial opportunity in the history of life sciences and the industry is shifting from “trial-and-error” approaches to data-driven molecular design. “We feel the momentum deeply, especially in our inboxes. A year and a half ago, when we founded the company, there was a lot of skepticism,” Gertz told TechCrunch. That skepticism has vanished remarkably quickly, thanks to successful case studies from companies like Converge and from academia, he added. Large language models are gaining attention in drug discovery for their ability to analyze biological sequences and suggest new molecules, but challenges like hallucinations and accuracy remain. “In text, hallucinations are usually easy to spot,” the CEO said. “In molecules, validating a novel compound can take weeks, so the cost is much higher.” To tackle this, Converge pairs generative models with predictive ones, filtering new molecules to reduce risk and improve outcomes for its partners. “This filtration isn’t perfect, but it significantly reduces risk and delivers better outcomes for our customers,” Gertz added. TechCrunch also asked about experts like Yann LeCun, who remain skeptical about using LLMs. “I’m a huge fan of Yann LeCun, and I completely agree with him. We don’t rely on text-based models for core scientific understanding. To truly understand biology, models need to be trained on DNA, RNA, proteins, and small molecules,” Gertz explained. Text-based LLMs are used only as support tools, for example, to help customers navigate literature on generated molecules. “They’re not our core technology,” Gertz said. “We’re not tied to a single architecture. We use LLMs, diffusion models, traditional machine learning, and statistical methods when it makes sense.” “Our vision is that every life-science organization will use Converge Bio as its generative AI lab. Wet labs will always exist, but they’ll be paired with generative labs that create hypotheses and molecules computationally. We want to be that generative lab for the entire industry,” Gertz said. The article has been updated to include information on the number of customers. "
Meta-backed Hupo finds growth after pivot to AI sales coaching from mental wellness,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/meta-backed-hupo-finds-growth-after-pivot-to-ai-sales-coaching-from-mental-wellness/,"When Justin Kim, co-founder and CEO of Hupo, first launched his company about four years ago, it wasn’t selling AI-powered sales coaching to banks, finance services, or insurance companies. The company originally began as Ami, a mental wellness platform focused on how people manage pressure, form habits, and change behavior over time. “I’ve always been a big sports fan — basketball, football, Formula One, MMA — and what draws me to all of them is performance. In my free time, I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about what actually drives human performance. People are very different, but across sports, there are clear patterns in how performance shows up,” Kim said in an interview with TechCrunch. His curiosity eventually shaped his professional focus. Kim started exploring what drives performance at work, and one theme kept surfacing: mental resilience. That idea led him to found a startup in 2022. Early work with Meta, which backed this startup in the seed round, helped sharpen some hard-earned lessons: Software only works when it fits into daily behavior like how people already live and work, and tools designed to help people “improve” often fail if they are judgmental, abstract, or disconnected from real work, Kim told TechCrunch. Those ideas followed the startup through its pivot, and today they shape Hupo’s approach to sales coaching; less about replacing human judgment and more about helping people in the moments that really matter in banking, insurance, and financial services. Kim said the shift wasn’t as dramatic as it might seem. “The core problem in both cases is performance at scale. In banking and insurance, results vary, not because of motivation, but because training, feedback, and confidence differ. Traditional coaching can’t reach everyone, and managers can’t sit in on every conversation.” AI that understands conversations in real time now allows teams to receive consistent coaching, even in the highly regulated, complex industry, Kim noted. Hupo has raised a $10 million Series A led by DST Global Partners, with participation from Collaborative Fund, Goodwater Capital, January Capital, and Strong Ventures. In addition, the Singapore-headquartered startup now serves dozens of customers in APAC and Europe, including Prudential, AXA, Manulife, HSBC, Bank of Ireland, and Grab. “BFSI [Banking, Financial Services and Insurance] is a notoriously difficult vertical for early-stage companies, but our customers typically expand contracts 3x to 8x within the first six months,” the founder said. “We’ll be expanding into the U.S. in the first half of this year, where distribution-heavy financial models create a strong need for scalable coaching.” Kim started his career at Bloomberg, selling enterprise software to banks, asset managers, and insurers, where he saw how complex regulated sales could be. He later worked on product development at South Korean fintech Viva Republica, the company behind Toss, learning how technology built around real user behavior could reshape traditional financial services. “Hupo sits at the intersection of those experiences. I understood the buyer, the end user, and the operational reality of selling financial products,” Kim said. “Once AI became capable of understanding context and coaching in real time, it became obvious to me that sales coaching — especially in banking and insurance — was the right place to apply it.” Many AI sales coaching tools start with the technology first, Kim said, but Hupo took a different approach, building its platform around how banks and insurers operate. “One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned is that, especially with large enterprises, you have to understand their business and industry in detail,” he added, noting that Hupo’s models were trained from the start on real financial products, common objections, client types, and regulatory requirements. The latest round brings total funding to $15 million since the company was founded in 2022. The new capital will go toward expanding its product, including real-time coaching features; scaling enterprise-grade deployments; growing go-to-market efforts in banking, financial services, and insurance; and building out the team. In five years, Kim says he wants Hupo to go beyond sales coaching and help large teams perform at scale, giving managers and employees clearer insights and practical guidance, even across tens of thousands of people.

"Hands-on with Bee, Amazon’s latest AI wearable",https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/hands-on-with-bee-amazons-latest-ai-wearable/,"In early tests with a review unit of Bee, we found the device itself was easy to use. It’s just a press of a button to turn recording on or off. In the app, you can configure whether a double press bookmarks a section of the conversation, processes the current conversation, or both, and you can set whether a press and hold gesture lets you leave a voice note or chat with the AI assistant. (Bee’s companion app currently reminds you to enable voice notes, so we did.) Like many other AI products and services, such as Plaud, Granola, Fathom, Fireflies, Otter, and more, Bee can listen, record, and transcribe audio conversations. Where it differs is that instead of offering an overview or a raw transcript, it segments the audio into sections and summarizes each part. For instance, an interview might be segmented into sections like the introduction, the nitty-gritty product details, an overview of industry trends, and whatever else you may have talked about. Each section is tinted with a different background color for easier differentiation as you scroll. You can tap into an individual section to see the exact transcription. It wasn’t immediately obvious how to label the speakers in the app — we learned we could tap on a segment of the conversation to confirm if we were the speaker, but this fell short of other professional AI transcribers, where each speaker could be labeled. In addition, Bee discards the audio after transcription, making it a non-starter for use cases where you need to play back the audio to ensure accuracy. That said, Bee isn’t necessarily meant to be a work tool. Amazon sees this as an AI that can live alongside you as you go about your day. By integrating with Google’s services, Bee can tie a recorded conversation to a task. For instance, after meeting someone at a conference, it could suggest that you friend them on LinkedIn or research their product. You can also leave yourself voice notes, as an alternative to writing something down in your notes app, for instance. Another section in Bee’s app lets you look back at past days’ memories, while a “Grow” section will offer insights the more it learns about you. You can also confirm and add to a “facts” section about yourself, which is somewhat equivalent to other AI chatbots’ ability to remember things you discussed. Amazon says it will be shipping more features for Bee in the year ahead. Bee isn’t always listening by default, which is why rival wearables like the Friend AI pendant saw backlash. Instead, you’re meant to ask if you can record someone’s conversation (unless at a public event of some sort, where recording is already expected). When you do record, a green light turns on, alerting others to the fact that the device is in use. Bee’s sports band was a little flimsy. The band fell off twice while being worn, both times while just sitting and not moving the hands much (like in a taxi). We have not yet tested the clip-on pin, but it feels more sturdy. Overall, the mobile app’s design is far ahead of the apps Amazon has built in-house, like the Alexa mobile experience, and it’s easy to use. But the premise that we need an AI specifically to record conversations to learn more about us is still largely untested. Is there a world where such devices make sense for consumers who aren’t recording in professional settings, like meetings and interviews? Plus, if AI listening devices go mainstream, there will also have to be some sort of cultural shift in terms of what’s appropriate and what’s not. Today, it’s somewhat looked down upon to record video of everyday people going about their lives, even though it’s technically legal when they’re in public; similarly, it may be considered tasteless or gauche to record audio with an AI device if you don’t first ask permission. Not everyone will abide by that social contract, of course, which could see people self-censoring their speech in public. At CES, for instance, we were chatting with a rep at the Soundcore booth. When they liked something I said about a competitor’s product, they joked, ‘Say that louder into my microphone,’ pointing to the already-recording AI device subtly pinned to their shirt. It was an odd experience to realize that everything said in the real world could one day be “on the record,” whether you consented or not. Bee’s traction — or lack thereof — will help Amazon determine if that’s a world that consumers actually want. "
"Why Amazon bought Bee, an AI wearable",https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/why-amazon-bought-bee-an-ai-wearable/,"Smart rings, smart screens, smart TVs, smart pins, smart … ice cube makers? Sure, why not! AI was everywhere at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, where companies large and small were showing off how they’re bringing AI to more devices. For Amazon, CES was a time to show off its newest acquisition in the space: Bee, an AI device that can be worn as a clip-on pin or a bracelet. Amazon already has an entry in the AI consumer devices space with Alexa, whose upgraded AI-powered version, Alexa+, can run on 97% of the hardware devices Amazon has shipped. However, with Bee, the company is gaining access to a wearable that could extend its reach outside the home. Largely designed for recording conversations like interviews, meetings, or classes, Bee also works as an AI companion. The AI has access to world knowledge, and it learns more about you from a combination of your recordings and the services you permit it to access like Gmail, Google Calendar, your phone’s contacts, and Apple Health. Given that Amazon has already tried integrating Alexa into wearables like earbuds and glasses, it could seem like the company is muddying the waters with the addition of another AI companion. However, those earlier Alexa devices have not taken off in the face of competition like Apple’s AirPods and Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses. Amazon seems to understand this, which is why it’s adding Bee to its lineup. “We see each other as complementary friends,” says Bee co-founder Maria de Lourdes Zollo of Bee’s relationship with Alexa, in an interview at CES last week. “Bee has the understanding of outside the house, and Alexa has the understanding of inside the house. Of course, there will be a future where these two things come together.” That future doesn’t yet mean Bee’s AI will be replaced by Alexa. Noted Amazon Alexa VP Daniel Rausch, Amazon thinks what the team at Bee created is an “important and lovable experience.” He describes Bee as a “deeply engaging and personal” AI, but he also agreed that, at some point, Alexa and Bee would come together. “We know that it will create even more benefit for customers than what [the AI experiences] do on their own,” Rausch explained. “When you have access to the power of these AI experiences with you throughout the day, and they’re continuous — we’re gonna be able to do so much more for customers.” De Lourdes Zollo said that Bee learns from its users, gaining an understanding of their patterns, insights, and commitments, which can help it to suggest to-do items and follow-ups throughout your day. Early use cases have included students who record lectures, elderly people who have trouble remembering things, and people who speak for a living and don’t want to always take notes manually. “They just want a place to have all the summarization of everything they said,” Bee’s co-founder said. “So based on that, we build a really big graph of knowledge [about] you, where you can go chat with Bee, and have an understanding of what happened to you, but also how you’re changing during the course of your life,” de Lourdes Zollo added. Similar to Alexa, Bee uses a combination of AI models under the hood, but it’s exploring adding Amazon’s AI as one in the mix. After transcribing the conversation, Bee discards the audio, making it impractical for many work-related use cases where you need to play back the conversation to ensure accuracy. There’s still much ahead for Bee in 2026, de Lourdes Zollo teased, without giving anything away. In addition to recent announcements of new features and functionality — like voice notes, templates, daily insights, and more — the founder said the eight-person team is working on “many new things” out of their HQ in San Francisco, where Amazon already has a large number of hardware and Alexa employees. “Honestly, it’s endless possibilities now, and that’s one of the reasons why we’re really excited to be part of Amazon,” she said.

Mark Zuckerberg says Meta is launching its own AI infrastructure initiative,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/mark-zuckerberg-says-meta-is-launching-its-own-ai-infrastructure-initiative/,"When Meta announced capital expenditure projections last year, the company made it known that it planned to spend big to build out capacity for its AI business. “We expect that developing leading AI infrastructure will be a core advantage in developing the best AI models and product experiences,” said Susan Li, Meta CFO, during an earnings call last summer. Now the tech giant appears to be making good on that promise. On Monday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the launch of Meta Compute, a new initiative designed to bolster the tech giant’s AI infrastructure. Zuckerberg said the company intended to drastically expand its energy footprint in the coming years. “Meta is planning to build tens of gigawatts this decade, and hundreds of gigawatts or more over time. How we engineer, invest, and partner to build this infrastructure will become a strategic advantage,” Zuckerberg said in a post on Threads. For reference, a gigawatt is a measurement of electrical power equivalent to a billion watts. The energy-hungry AI business means that America’s electrical consumption could spike exponentially over the next decade (from 5 GW to 50, according to one estimate). Zuckerberg has named three executives that he says will be spearheading the new project. One of those people is Santosh Janardhan, the company’s head of global infrastructure. Janardhan, who has been with the company since 2009, will lead work on “technical architecture, software stack, silicon program, developer productivity, and building and operating our global datacenter fleet and network,” Zuckerberg said. Also involved is Daniel Gross, who joined the company just last year. Gross is the co-founder of Safe Superintelligence, along with former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever. Zuckerberg said that Gross would be leading a new group within Meta that is “responsible for long-term capacity strategy, supplier partnerships, industry analysis, planning, and business modeling.” Finally, Zuckerberg said that Dina Powell McCormick, a former government official who recently joined Meta as the company’s president and vice chairman, would be responsible for working with governments to help “build, deploy, invest in, and finance Meta’s infrastructure.” There’s obviously a race to build out generative AI-ready cloud environments, and Capex projections announced last year showed most of Meta’s peers had similar ambitions. Microsoft has been busy partnering with AI infrastructure providers wherever it can, and in December, Google parent company Alphabet announced the acquisition of data center firm Intersect. TechCrunch reached out to Meta for more information about the new initiative.  "
Anthropic announces Claude for Healthcare following OpenAI’s ChatGPT Health reveal,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/anthropic-announces-claude-for-healthcare-following-openais-chatgpt-health-reveal/,"On the heels of OpenAI’s ChatGPT Health reveal, Anthropic announced on Sunday that it’s introducing Claude for Healthcare, a set of tools for providers, payers, and patients. Like ChatGPT Health, Claude for Healthcare will allow users to sync health data from their phones, smartwatches, and other platforms (both OpenAI and Anthropic have said that their models won’t use this data for training). But Anthropic’s product promises more sophistication than ChatGPT Health, which seems as though it will be more focused on a patient-side chat experience as it rolls out gradually. Though some industry professionals are concerned about the role of hallucination-prone LLMs in offering clients medical advice, Anthropic’s “agent skills” seem promising. Claude has added what it calls “connectors” to give the AI access to platforms and databases that can speed up research processes and report generation for payers and providers, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Coverage Database; the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10); the National Provider Identifier Standard; and PubMed. Anthropic explained in a blog post that Claude for Health could use its connectors to speed up prior authorization review, the process in which a doctor must submit additional information to an insurance provider to see if it will cover a medication or treatment. “Clinicians often report spending more time on documentation and paperwork than actually seeing patients,” Anthropic CPO Mike Krieger said in a presentation about the product. For doctors, submitting prior authorization documents is more of an administrative task than something that requires their specialized training and expertise. It’s something that makes more sense to automate than the actual process of administering medical advice … though Claude will do that as well. People are already relying on LLMs for medical advice. OpenAI said that 230 million people talk about their health with ChatGPT each week, and there’s no doubt that Anthropic is observing that use case as well. Of course, both Anthropic and OpenAI warn consumers that they should see healthcare professionals for more reliable, tailored guidance. "
Anthropic’s new Cowork tool offers Claude Code without the code,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/anthropics-new-cowork-tool-offers-claude-code-without-the-code/,"On Monday, Anthropic announced a new tool called Cowork, designed as a more accessible version of Claude Code. Built into the Claude Desktop app, the new tool lets users designate a specific folder where Claude can read or modify files, with further instructions given through the standard chat interface. The result is similar to a sandboxed instance of Claude Code, but requires far less technical savvy to set up. Currently in research preview, Cowork is only available to Max subscribers, with a waitlist available for users on other plans. The new tool is inspired in part by the growing number of subscribers using Claude Code to achieve non-coding tasks, treating it as a general-purpose agentic AI tool. Cowork is built on the Claude Agent SDK, which means it’s drawing on the same underlying model as Claude Code. The folder partition gives an easy way to manage what files Cowork has access to, and because the app doesn’t require command-line tools or virtual environments, it’s less intimidating for non-technical users. That opens up a new world of potential use cases. Anthropic gives the example of assembling an expense report from a folder of receipt photos — but Claude Code users have also put the system to work managing media files, scanning social media posts, or analyzing conversations. Similar to Claude Code, Cowork is designed to take strings of actions without user input — a potentially dangerous approach if the tool is given vague or contradictory instructions. In a blog post announcing the new tool, Anthropic explicitly warns about the risk of prompt injection or deleted files, recommending that users make instructions as clear and unambiguous as possible. “These risks aren’t new with Cowork,” the post reads, “but it might be the first time you’re using a more advanced tool that moves beyond a simple conversation.” Launched as a command-line tool in November 2024, Claude Code has become one of Anthropic’s most successful products, leading the company to launch a string of new interfaces in recent months. A web interface launched in October, followed by a Slack integration just two months later."
Amazon says 97% of its devices can support Alexa+,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/amazon-says-97-of-its-devices-can-support-alexa/,"Amazon offered a bit more insight into how it sees its AI platform competing in the real world at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week. Namely, Amazon plans to leverage the extensive footprint its devices already have in the home as well as consumers’ existing familiarity with its Alexa brand. “Ninety-seven percent of devices we ever shipped can support Alexa+,” noted Amazon Alexa and Echo VP Daniel Rausch in an interview at CES. He said the latest figures Amazon has on hand indicate the company has sold more than 600 million devices, and the “vast majority” will support its revamped AI assistant, Alexa+. Announced early last year, Alexa+ is Amazon’s future in the generative AI market, offering more expressive voices, access to world knowledge similar to other AI assistants, and AI agents that perform tasks on behalf of the customer — like calling an Uber or ordering food. The company has been steadily rolling out access to the AI platform, with more than 1 million Alexa customers gaining access by last June, and now, “tens of millions” can opt in to upgrade to the AI assistant. Amazon doesn’t have an exact date for when Alexa+ will be available to everyone; the company is focusing first on bringing the AI to all Prime members. What Amazon soon has to prove, beyond availability, is whether customers will actually use its AI. That’s where Rausch believes Alexa’s existing footprint will help. “I think that there’s going to be a whole range of AI out there for customers. I think that Alexa will be one of the foundational assistants,” he said. While he believes there will always be some specialist AIs on the market, like those that focus on one thing, like being a legal assistant, there will be a few “nameable, foundational AIs that are highly capable,” which is where Alexa slots in. “I think some of the advantages Alexa has is the familiarity of customers, the tens of millions of customers already engaging continuously,” Rausch said. “It’s in the home, ambiently available, in voice, in the most natural interface. I do believe that that’s our opportunity to grow,” he added. Alexa’s plans for the home come as Apple announced it’s teaming up with Google’s Gemini for Siri, as other AI chatbots, like ChatGPT and Claude, compete across a variety of use cases ranging from research to healthcare to coding and more. Just ahead of CES, Amazon announced a way to access Alexa on the web and a redesigned Alexa app that puts a chatbot-style interface front and center. At the conference, Amazon partners like Samsung, BMW, and Oura showed off their Alexa integrations. The company also promoted its recent acquisition of Bee, an AI wearable that lets you record conversations and gain insights. Customers can engage with Bee via text or voice chat. In the future, Rausch says Alexa and Bee will become more integrated. But, he added, Bee has value as its own standalone brand, calling it a “an important and lovable experience.”"
Google’s Gemini to power Apple’s AI features like Siri,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/googles-gemini-to-power-apples-ai-features-like-siri/,"It’s official. Apple has chosen to work with Google, a longtime partner, to power AI features like Siri.  “After careful evaluation, we determined that Google’s technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and we’re excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for our users,” Apple and Google said in a statement. The partnership confirms previous reporting on a deal with Google. Neither Apple nor Google have confirmed the price tag, but previous reports indicate Apple could be paying Google around $1 billion for access to its AI technology. The deal also comes after Apple spent some time testing the technology of competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic.  The multi-year partnership will involve Apple using Google’s Gemini models and cloud technology for future Apple foundational models. The deal is not exclusive, per a source familiar with the matter. Apple has historically focused on vertical integration, relying on its own hardware and software. The iPhone-maker has faced a fair amount of public chatter criticizing it after its AI efforts, particularly its assistant Siri, lagged behind competitors. That’s not to say Apple hasn’t been quietly building powerful foundational models. The company released the first versions of Apple Intelligence in 2024, which adds AI to existing OS functions like searching for photos and summarizing notifications. Apple has also focused on privacy with its AI rollout, with much of the processing happening on-device or through tightly controlled infrastructure. Apple says it will maintain those privacy standards throughout its partnership with Google.  The firm’s strategy has resulted in a subtle, sometimes invisible, occasionally resented form of AI — one that doesn’t have the same wow factor as ChatGPT or Gemini. It also stops short of delivering the kind of Siri overhaul many users have been waiting for. Apple has delayed the rollout of its “more personalized Siri” voice assistant several times, but a spokesperson told TechCrunch an upgrade is coming this year. Previous reports indicate the overhauled Siri is expected to launch in the spring.  Apple’s partnership with Google also comes as the search and adtech giant is in the midst of multiple antitrust lawsuits, including one that put its relationship with Apple front and center. In August 2024, a federal judge ruled that Google acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search by paying companies like Apple to present its search engine as the default on its devices and web browsers. Between 2021 and 2022, Google paid Apple about $38 billion to secure default search placements.  In December 2025, Judge Amit Mehta issued his final remedies on the case, which include banning Google from entering into exclusive, default agreements like the one it had with Apple “unless the agreement terminates no more than one year after the date it is entered.”"
A New Jersey lawsuit shows how hard it is to fight deepfake porn,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/a-new-jersey-lawsuit-shows-how-hard-it-is-to-fight-deepfake-porn/,"For more than two years, an app called ClothOff has been terrorizing young women online — and it’s been maddeningly difficult to stop. The app has been taken down from the two major app stores and it’s banned from most social platforms, but it’s still available on the web and through a Telegram bot. In October, a clinic at Yale Law School filed a lawsuit that would take down the app entirely, forcing the owners to delete all images and cease operation entirely. But simply finding the defendants has been a challenge.  “It’s incorporated in the British Virgin Islands,” explains Professor John Langford, a co-lead counsel in the lawsuit, “but we believe it’s run by a brother and sister in Belarus. It may even be part of a larger network around the world.” It’s a bitter lesson in the wake of the recent flood of non-consensual pornography generated by Elon Musk’s xAI, which included many underage victims. Child sexual abuse material is the most legally toxic content on the internet — illegal to produce, transmit, or store, and regularly scanned for on every major cloud service. But despite the intense legal prohibitions, there are still few ways to deal with image generators like ClothOff, as Langford’s case demonstrates. Individual users can be prosecuted, but platforms like ClothOff and Grok are far more difficult to police, leaving few options for victims hoping to find justice in court. The clinic’s complaint, which is available online, paints an alarming picture. The plaintiff is an anonymous high school student in New Jersey, whose classmates used ClothOff to alter her Instagram photos. She was 14 years old when the original Instagram photos were taken, which means the AI-modified versions are legally classified as child abuse imagery. But even though the modified images are straightforwardly illegal, local authorities declined to prosecute the case, citing the difficulty of obtaining evidence from suspects’ devices. “Neither the school nor law enforcement ever established how broadly the CSAM of Jane Doe and other girls was distributed,” the complaint reads. Still, the court case has moved slowly. The complaint was filed in October, and in the months since, Langford and his colleagues have been in the process of serving notice to the defendants — a difficult task given the global nature of the enterprise. Once they’ve been served, the clinic can push for a court appearance and, eventually, a judgment, but in the meantime the legal system has given little comfort to ClothOff’s victims. The Grok case might seem like a simpler problem to fix. Elon Musk’s xAI isn’t hiding, and there’s plenty of money at the end for lawyers who can win a claim. But Grok is a general-purpose tool, which makes it much harder to hold it accountable in court. “ClothOff is designed and marketed specifically as a deepfake pornography image and video generator,” Langford told me. “When you’re suing a general system that users can query for all sorts of things, it gets a lot more complicated.” A number of U.S. laws have already banned deepfake pornography — most notably the Take It Down Act. But while specific users are clearly breaking those laws, it’s much harder to hold the entire platform accountable. Existing laws require clear evidence of an intent to harm, which would mean providing evidence xAI knew their tool would be used to produce non-consensual pornography. Without that evidence, xAI’s basic first amendment rights would provide significant legal protection. “In terms of the First Amendment, it’s quite clear Child Sexual Abuse material is not protected expression,” Langford says. “So when you’re designing a system to create that kind of content, you’re clearly operating outside of what’s protected by the First Amendment. But when you’re a general system that users can query for all sorts of things, it’s not so clear.” The easiest way to surmount those problems would be to show that xAI had willfully ignored the problem. It’s a real possibility, given recent reporting that Musk directed employees to loosen Grok’s safeguards. But even then, it would be a far riskier case to take on.   “Reasonable people can say, we knew this was a problem years ago,” Langford says. “How can you not have had more stringent controls in place to make sure this doesn’t happen? That is a kind of recklessness or knowledge but it’s just a more complicated case.” Those First Amendment issues are why xAI’s biggest pushback has come from court systems without robust legal protections for free speech. Both Indonesia and Malaysia have taken steps to block access to the Grok chatbot, while regulators in the United Kingdom have opened an investigation that could lead to a similar ban. Other preliminary steps have been taken by the European Commission, France, Ireland, India, and Brazil. In contrast, no U.S. regulatory agency has issued an official response. It’s impossible to say how the investigations will resolve, but at the very least, the flood of imagery raises lots of questions for regulators to investigate — and the answers could be damning. “If you are posting, distributing, disseminating Child Sexual Abuse material, you are violating criminal prohibitions and can be held accountable,” Langford says. “The hard question is, what did X know? What did X do or not do? What are they doing now in response to it?“"
"Harmattan AI raises $200M Series B led by Dassault Aviation, becomes defense unicorn",https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/harmattan-ai-raises-200m-series-b-led-by-dassault-aviation-becomes-defense-unicorn/,"French defense tech company Harmattan AI is rising almost as fast as the supersonic planes of its new backer. Founded in 2024, the company is now valued at $1.4 billion after raising a $200 million Series B round led by Dassault Aviation, which is best known for making the Rafale fighter jet. Harmattan AI, which builds autonomy and mission-system software for defense aircraft, had already received strong validation signals from the French and British ministries of defense in its less than two years of existence. But this funding and the accompanying partnership will give new wings to a company that once described itself as a “European Anduril.” Like its American peer, Harmattan AI once aspired to overtake defense incumbents, which are also known as primes. But the company is now also ready to partner with them — even if it means no longer calling itself “a next-generation defense prime.” According to Harmattan’s latest press release, the now “defense technology company” will help Dassault Aviation shape the future of air combat by developing embedded AI capabilities for its next generations of Rafales and drones while making sure this implementation is both sovereign and scalable. The use of drones in Ukraine has been a wake-up call for NATO armies, creating tailwinds for defense tech startups that can help them adapt. According to Harmattan AI, which recently partnered with Ukrainian drone maker Skyeton, the funding will help it extend its product offering into new domains and scale manufacturing of its platforms for drone interception, electronic warfare, and ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance). French president Emmanuel Macron praised the announcement on social media, calling it “excellent news for our strategic autonomy, for the technological superiority of our armed forces in the field of AI-activated defense drones, as well as for our economy.” While important for France, this strategic play isn’t exclusive. Harmattan AI’s stated goal of “empowering the armed forces of liberal democracies and their allies” leaves some wiggle room for the company to sell its technology beyond France and Europe. The company is already putting this into action: it will exhibit at the World Defense Show in Riyadh next month, and is expanding its U.S. team.  The company claimed a new record in July when it was awarded a “multi-million-U.S. dollar contract by a NATO government” for the delivery of AI-enabled small drones, just one year after its founding. But according to its CEO and co-founder, Mouad M’Ghari, Harmattan AI is now “entering a new phase of scale” as it seeks to “ramp-up manufacturing.” In that same LinkedIn post, the entrepreneur disclosed that the new funding comes in addition to the $42 million Harmattan AI had raised to date, including a seed round led by Atlantic and a Series A led by FirstMark, with other backers including Motier Ventures and Sisyphus Ventures. Meanwhile, Harmattan AI’s CTO and co-founder Martin de Gourcuff chose a different note with political undertones. “As the international order goes off the rails,” he wrote, “we are entering an era where, increasingly, power precedes law. A reversal of the civilized world we strive for. Harmattan AI exists to protect our values and flip that relationship back, as power without law is just mere violence.” This story was updated to correct Skyeton’s origins."
Motional puts AI at center of robotaxi reboot as it targets 2026 for driverless service,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/11/motional-puts-ai-at-center-of-robotaxi-reboot-as-it-targets-2026-for-driverless-service/,"Nearly two years ago, Motional was at an autonomous vehicle crossroads.  The company, born from a $4 billion joint venture between Hyundai Motor Group and Aptiv, had already missed a deadline to launch a driverless robotaxi service with partner Lyft. It had lost Aptiv as one of its financial backers, prompting Hyundai to step up with another $1 billion investment to keep it going. Several layoffs, including a 40% restructuring cut in May 2024, had whittled the company from its peak of about 1,400 employees to less than 600. Meanwhile, advancements in AI were changing how engineers were developing the technology.  Motional was going to have to evolve or die. It paused everything and picked option No. 1. Motional told TechCrunch it has rebooted its robotaxi plans with an AI-first approach to its self-driving system and a promise to launch a commercial driverless service in Las Vegas by the end of 2026. The company has already opened up a robotaxi service — with a human safety operator behind the wheel — to its employees. It plans to offer that service to the public with an unnamed ride-hailing partner later this year. (Motional has existing relationships with Lyft and Uber.) By the end of the year, the human safety operator will be pulled from the robotaxis and a true commercial driverless service will begin, the company said. “We saw that there was tremendous potential with all the advancements that were happening within AI; and we also saw that while we had a safe, driverless system, there was a gap to getting to an affordable solution that could generalize and scale globally,” Motional president and CEO Laura Major said during a presentation at the company’s Las Vegas facilities. “And so we made the very hard decision to pause our commercial activities, to slow down in the near term so that we could speed up.” This meant shifting away from its classic robotics approach to an AI foundation model-based one. Motional was never devoid of AI. Motional’s self-driving system used individual machine learning models to handle perception, tracking, and semantic reasoning. But it also used more rules-based programs for other operations within the software stack. And the individual ML models made it a complex web of software, Major said. Meanwhile, AI models originally built for language began to be applied in robots and other physical AI systems, including the development of autonomous driving. That transformer architecture made it possible to build large and complex AI models, ultimately leading to the emergence, and skyrocketing use, of ChatGPT.  Motional searched for ways to combine these smaller models and integrate them into a single backbone, allowing for an end-to-end architecture. It has also maintained the smaller models for developers, which Major explained gives Motional the best of both worlds. “This is really critical for two things; one is for generalizing more easily to new cities, new environments, new scenarios,” she said. “And the other is to do this in a cost-optimized way. So for example, the traffic lights might be different in the next city you go to, but you don’t have to redevelop or re-analyze those. You just collect some data, train the model, and it’s capable of operating safely in that new city.” TechCrunch got a firsthand look at Motional’s new approach during a 30-minute autonomous drive around Las Vegas. One demo can’t provide an accurate assessment of a self-driving system. It can, however, pinpoint weaknesses and differences from previous iterations, and gauge progress.  Progress is what I saw as the Hyundai Ioniq 5 I rode in autonomously navigated its way off Las Vegas Boulevard and into the pickup and drop-off area of the Aria Hotel. These bustling areas are notorious in La Vegas and my experience was no different as the autonomous vehicle slowly nudged its way around a stopped taxi and unloading passengers, changed lanes, then back again, passing dozens of people, giant flower pots, and cars along the way. Motional previously operated a ride-hailing service in Las Vegas with partner Lyft using vehicles that would autonomously handle portions of a ride. Parking lots and hotel valet and app ride pickup areas were never part of those operations. A human safety operator, always behind the wheel, would take over to navigate parking lots or the busy pickup and drop-off points of hotel lobbies. There is still more progress to be made. The graphics displayed to riders within the vehicle are still under development. And while there was never a disengagement during my demo ride — which means the human safety operator takes over — the vehicle did take its time to nudge itself around a double-parked Amazon delivery van. Still, Major argues Motional is on the right path to deploy safely and cost-effectively. And its majority owner Hyundai is in it for the long haul, she said. “I think the real long-term vision, you know, for all of this, is putting Level 4 on people’s personal cars,” Major said, referring to a term that mean the system handles all driving with no expectation of human intervention. “Robotaxis, that’s stop number one, and huge impact. But ultimately, I think any OEM would love to also integrate that into their cars.”"
Google removes AI Overviews for certain medical queries,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/11/google-removes-ai-overviews-for-certain-medical-queries/,"Following an investigation by The Guardian that found Google AI Overviews offering misleading information in response to certain health-related queries, the company appears to have removed the AI Overviews for some of those queries. For example, The Guardian initially reported that when users asked “what is the normal range for liver blood tests,” they would be presented with numbers that did not account for factors such as nationality, sex, ethnicity, or age, potentially leading them to think their results were healthy when they were not. Now, The Guardian says AI Overviews have been removed from the results for “what is the normal range for liver blood tests” and “what is the normal range for liver function tests.” However, it found that variations on those queries, such as “lft reference range” or “lft test reference range,” could still lead to AI-generated summaries. When I tried those queries this morning — several hours after The Guardian published its story — none of them resulted in seeing AI Overviews, though Google still gave me the option to ask the same query in AI Mode. In several cases, the top result was actually The Guardian article about the removal. A Google spokesperson told The Guardian that the company does not “comment on individual removals within Search,” but that it works to “make broad improvements.” The spokesperson also said that an internal team of clinicians reviewed the queries highlighted by The Guardian and found “in many instances, the information was not inaccurate and was also supported by high quality websites.” TechCrunch has reached out to Google for additional comment. Last year, the company announced new features aimed at improving Google Search for healthcare use cases, including improved overviews and health-focused AI models. Vanessa Hebditch, the director of communications and policy at the British Liver Trust, told The Guardian that the removal is “excellent news,” but added, “Our bigger concern with all this is that it is nit-picking a single search result and Google can just shut off the AI Overviews for that but it’s not tackling the bigger issue of AI Overviews for health.”"
"Indonesia and Malaysia block Grok over nonconsensual, sexualized deepfakes",https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/11/indonesia-blocks-grok-over-non-consensual-sexualized-deepfakes/,"Officials from Indonesia and Malaysia have said they are temporarily blocking access to xAI’s chatbot Grok. These are the most aggressive moves so far from government officials responding to a flood of sexualized, AI-generated imagery — often depicting real women and minors, and sometimes depicting violence — posted by Grok in response to requests from users on the social network X. (X and xAI are part of the same company.) In a statement shared Saturday with the Guardian and other publications, Indonesia’s communications and digital minister Meutya Hafid said, “The government views the practice of non-consensual sexual deepfakes as a serious violation of human rights, dignity, and the security of citizens in the digital space.” The ministry has also reportedly summoned X officials to discuss the issue. The New York Times said the Malaysian government announced a similar ban on Sunday. Varied governmental responses over the past week include an order from India’s IT ministry for X to take action to prevent Grok from generating obscene content, as well as an order from the European Commission for the company to retain all documents related to Grok, potentially setting the stage for an investigation. In the United Kingdom, the communications regulator Ofcom has said that it will “undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation.” Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in an interview that Ofcom has his “full support to take action.” And while in the United States, the Trump administration appears to be staying silent on the issue (xAI CEO Elon Musk is a major Trump donor and led the administration’s controversial Department of Government Efficiency last year), Democratic senators have called on Apple and Google to remove X from their app stores. xAI initially responded by posting a seemingly first-person apology to the Grok account, acknowledging that a post “violated ethical standards and potentially US laws” around child sexual abuse material. It later restricted the AI image-generation feature to paying subscribers on X, though that restriction did not appear to affect the Grok app itself, which still allowed anyone to generate images. In response to a post wondering why the U.K. government wasn’t taking action against other AI image generation tools, Musk wrote, “They want any excuse for censorship.” This post was first published on January 11. It has been updated to reflect Malaysia’s ban on Grok."
Google announces a new protocol to facilitate commerce using AI agents,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/11/google-announces-a-new-protocol-to-facilitate-commerce-using-ai-agents/,"Google on Sunday announced a new open standard called the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) for AI agent-based shopping, at the National Retail Federation (NRF) conference. The standard, developed with companies like Shopify, Etsy, Wayfair, Target, and Walmart, lets agents work across different parts of customer buying processes, including discovery and post-purchase support. The core idea is that the standard could facilitate these various parts of the process instead of requiring connections with different agents. Google said that it also works with other agentic protocols, such as Agent Payments Protocol (AP2) — which Google announced last year — Agent2Agent (A2A), and Model Context Protocol (MCP). The company specified that Agents and Businesses can pick and choose specific extensions of the protocol that suits their needs. The company said that it will soon use UCP for eligible Google product listings in AI mode in search and the Gemini apps to let shoppers check out directly from U.S.-based retailers while researching a product. Users will be able to pay using Google Pay and pass on the shipping information saved in the Google Wallet. Google said that it will soon support PayPal as a payment option. “This is one of the really exciting parts about agentic,” said Shopify CEO and founder Tobi Lütke. “It’s really good at finding people who have specific interests and finding the product that is just perfect for them. Like, I would have never searched for this product, but somehow it found me right on the other side. This kind of serendipity is where the best of commerce happens.” Notably, Shopify also unveiled a similar integration with Microsoft Copilot for shopping today to let customers check out easily within the conversational flow. In another consumer-facing change, Google said it will now allow brands to offer a special discount to users while they are looking for a product recommendation when using the AI mode. For instance, if you are searching for a rug using a query like “I’m looking for a modern, stylish rug for a high-traffic dining room. I host a lot of dinner parties, so I want something that is easy to clean,” brands can set up their campaign in a way to offer you a discount at that moment. The company is also giving users new data attributes within the Merchant Center to have sellers feature their items better within AI search surfaces. Companies like PayPal and OpenAI are also working on having sellers be more discoverable in AI chatbot results. Startups like the Prompting Company are also working with merchants to have their products surface within AI answers. Google is now also allowing merchants to integrate a branded AI-powered Business Agent within Google Search to answer customer questions. The company noted that merchants like Lowe’s, Michaels, Poshmark, and Reebok are already using this product. Competitors like Shopify and Meta have been exploring AI-powered tools for businesses for customer support and outreach. The search giant also announced Gemini Enterprise for Customer Experience (CX), a suite to handle shopping and customer service for retailers and restaurants. Companies like Google, Amazon, Walmart, and OpenAI have been releasing new standards and products to infuse AI into every bit of shopping, both on the consumer and merchant side. Earlier in the month, Adobe noted that traffic driven to seller sites by generative AI grew by 693.4% during the holiday season, though the report didn’t specify how much of this traffic translated into sales. The story has been updated to reflect that retailers can use AI agents inside Google Search."
OpenAI is reportedly asking contractors to upload real work from past jobs,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/10/openai-is-reportedly-asking-contractors-to-upload-real-work-from-past-jobs/,"OpenAI and training data company Handshake AI are asking third-party contractors to upload real work that they did in past and current jobs, according to a report in Wired. This appears to be part of a broader strategy across AI companies that are hiring contractors to generate high-quality training data in the hopes that this will eventually allow their models to automate more white-collar work. In OpenAI’s case, a company presentation reportedly asks contractors to describe tasks they’ve performed at other jobs and upload examples of “real, on-the-job work” that they’ve “actually done.” These examples can include “a concrete output (not a summary of the file, but the actual file), e.g., Word doc, PDF, Powerpoint, Excel, image, repo.” The company reportedly instructs contractors to delete proprietary and personally identifiable information before uploading, and it points them to a ChatGPT “Superstar Scrubbing” tool to do so. Nonetheless, intellectual property lawyer Evan Brown told Wired that any AI lab taking this approach is “putting itself at great risk” with an approach that requires “a lot of trust in its contractors to decide what is and isn’t confidential.” An OpenAI spokesperson declined to comment."
"CES 2026: Everything revealed, from Nvidia’s debuts to AMD’s new chips to Razer’s AI oddities ",https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/09/ces-2026-everything-revealed-from-nvidias-debuts-to-amds-new-chips-to-razers-ai-oddities/,"CES 2026 is winding down in Las Vegas, as the consumer tech industry and everyone swarming around it begin their return flights home. Over the past few days, we saw a slew of announcements from mainstays like Nvidia, Sony, and AMD, along with smaller companies and startups vying for attention through the Unveiled event (CES’s showcase for new products) and across the show floor.  As has been the case for the past two years, AI was at the forefront of many companies’ messaging, though the hardware upgrades and oddities that have long defined the annual event still have their place on the show floor and in adjacent announcements. This year, physical AI was particularly prominent, taking the place that agentic AI held last year as the show’s buzzy topic. That focus on physical AI came alongside a big focus on robotics, with robots demonstrated all over the show and showcased in numerous press events.  To relive the reactions and thoughts from our team on the ground, you can go back in time via our live blog right here. Otherwise, let’s dive into some of the biggest and most notable announcements from CES.  If audio or video are more your thing, then head right to the latest episode of our Equity podcast, which goes into detail about what we thought about the show, or watch the full episode below on YouTube.  Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivered an expectedly lengthy presentation at CES, taking a victory lap for the company’s AI-driven successes, setting the stage for 2026, and yes, hanging out with some robots.  The Rubin computing architecture, which has been developed to meet the increasing computation demands that AI adoption creates, is set to begin replacing Blackwell architecture in the second half of this year. It comes with speed and storage upgrades, but our senior AI editor Russell Brandom goes into the nitty-gritty of what distinguishes Rubin.  And Nvidia continued its push to bring the AI revolution into the physical world, showcasing its Alpamayo family of open source AI models and tools that will be used by autonomous vehicles this year. That approach, as senior reporter Rebecca Bellan notes, mirrors the company’s broader efforts to make its infrastructure the Android for generalist robots.  AMD chair and CEO Lisa Su delivered the first keynote of CES, with a presentation that featured partners, including OpenAI president Greg Brockman, AI legend Fei-Fei Li, Luma AI CEO Amit Jain, and more.  Beyond the partner showcases, senior reporter Rebecca Szkutak detailed AMD’s approach toward expanding the reach of AI through personal computers using its Ryzen AI 400 Series processors.  Let’s face it, by this point in the show the major announcements have been made, products have been showcased, and it’s time to eye some of the most brow-raising reveals from CES. We started our list of what stood out to us as odd and noteworthy, but we’re open to more suggestions!  CES isn’t all hardware showcases and show floor attractions — there are plenty of additional industry panels and speakers drawing eyeballs. We kept tabs on a few notable highlights, ranging from Palmer Luckey pushing retro aesthetics, to why the “learn once, work forever” era may be over, to previews of the new Silicon Valley-based series “The Audacity,” to the expansion of Roku’s $3 streaming service, to All-In host Jason Calacanis putting a $25,000 bounty on an authentic Theranos device.  Ford is launching its assistant in the company’s app before a targeted 2027 release in its vehicles, with hosting managed by Google Cloud and the assistant itself built using off-the-shelf LLMs. As we noted in our coverage of the news, however, few details were offered around what drivers should expect from their experience with the assistant.  As part of the ever-present push for AI’s impact on the physical world, Caterpillar and Nvidia announced a pilot program, “Cat AI Assistant,” which was demonstrated at CES Wednesday. This system, coming to one of Caterpillar’s excavator vehicles, is happening alongside another project to use Nvidia’s Omniverse simulation resources to help with construction project planning and execution.  One of the buzziest reveals of the show is the debut phone from Clicks Technology, the $499 Communicator, which brings back BlackBerry vibes with its physical keyboard, plus a separate $79 slide-out physical keyboard that can be used with other devices. Check out our full rundown from the show floor here, but the Communicator makes a good first impression, per Consumer Editor Sarah Perez: “In our hands-on test, the phone felt good to hold — not too heavy or light, and was easy to grip. Gadway told me the company settled on the device’s final form after dozens of 3D-printed shapes. The winning design for the phone features a contoured back that makes it easy to pick up and hold. “The device’s screen is also somewhat elevated off the body, and its chin is curved up to create a recess that protects the keys when you place it face down.” A big part of LG’s CES presentation was dedicated to its robotics efforts, with home robot CLOiD as a prominent figurehead. And how did the robot fare once it was off the press conference stage and out in the wild? We’ll let Senior Writer Lucas Ropek’s impressions speak for themselves:  “Unfortunately, at the presentation I saw, CLOiD didn’t do a whole lot. I saw the bot very gingerly take a shirt out of a basket and place it into a dryer. I also saw it pick up a croissant and (again, very gingerly) place it into an oven. In addition to the live performance from the bot, the presentation was intercut with highly produced videos of the bot in a number of hypothetical scenarios where it might prove useful to potential users.”  Long used in industrial settings, UV printers that can print ink directly onto objects have been prohibitively expensive for individuals to own. But the eufyMake E1 is set to launch for $2,299 later this year, which makes bulk printing on things like mugs, water bottles, and phone cases a bit more attainable for individuals. Lucas Ropek has more first impressions here.   MyCommuters has a novel take on creating office space by helping companies find locations that are beneficial to them and their employees. The platform pulls together different datasets to examine commute time, expenses, and other factors to identify an ideal spot for an office, not just the easiest thing to spot that’s on the market. Sean O’Kane has more reporting on the idea that drove founder Guillaume Acier to start the company here.  This family planning tool caught our eye on the show floor, not just for its calendar and planning capabilities, but for its AI capabilities that are able to sync calendars from different sources; create new to-dos based off of messages or photos, appointment reminders; and more. Check out our full impressions here.  Hyundai’s press conference focused on its robotics partnerships with Boston Dynamics, but the companies revealed that they’re working with Google’s AI research lab rather than competitors to train and operate existing Atlas robots, as well as a new iteration of the humanoid robot that was shown onstage. Transportation editor Kirsten Korosec has the full rundown.  Amazon’s AI-centric update with Alexa+ is getting the kind of push you’d expect at CES, with the company launching Alexa.com for Early Access customers looking to use the chatbot via their browsers, along with a similar, revamped bot-focused app. Consumer editor Sarah Perez has the details, along with news on Amazon’s revamp to Fire TV and new Artline TVs, which have their own Alexa+ push.  On the Ring front, consumer reporter Ivan Mehta runs through the many announcements, from fire alerts to an app store for third-party camera integration, and more.  In the past, Razer has been all about ridiculous hardware at CES, from three-screen laptops to haptic gaming cushions to a mask that landed the company a federal fine. This year, its two attention-grabbing announcements were for Project Motoko, which aims to function similarly to smart glasses, but without the glasses.  Then there’s Project AVA, which puts the avatar of an AI companion on your desk. We’ll let you watch the concept video for yourself.  Lego joined CES for the first time to hold a behind-closed-doors showcase of its Smart Play System, which includes bricks, tiles, and Minifigures that can all interact with each other and play sounds, with both the debut sets having a Star Wars theme. Senior writer Amanda Silberling has all the details here.  "
"How the Sleepbuds maker, Ozlo, is building a platform for sleep data",https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/09/how-the-sleepbuds-maker-ozlo-is-building-a-platform-for-sleep-data/,"Ozlo, the maker of comfortable, easy-to-use Sleepbuds that drown out outside noise so you can get better rest, is turning its product into a platform. The company’s plan began to take shape last month with the announcement of a partnership between Ozlo and meditation app Calm. But it kicked into high gear at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week as the company met with prospective partners to expand its reach. Those new partners could help Ozlo tap into new audiences and build a revenue model beyond consumer-focused hardware and into the profit-margin-rich world of software subscriptions and healthcare. For instance, software features that use AI or are designed to provide relief to users with tinnitus could be offered as premium subscriptions. And a recent acquisition of a neurotech startup should help Ozlo expand beyond being a consumer product to entering the medical device market, too. Founded by former Bose employees, Ozlo always intended to build an ecosystem, Ozlo co-founder and CEO NB Patil explained on the sidelines of CES. “The way we did that from the beginning is we built the iOS and Android SDK — so our first-party app actually runs on that SDK. That means whatever you see in our app can be made available to anybody,” Patil said. The mental wellness company Calm, for instance, could use the SDK to tell whether its sleep and meditation content is actually resonating with its customers. While Calm can’t tell from its own app if customers have fallen asleep, Ozlo’s sensors could. The device detects how body movements and respiration rates change, and that data is sent to the Ozlo charging case. There, a machine learning algorithm determines whether someone is asleep or is relaxed. Ozlo’s smart case has other sensors as well, including a temperature sensor and a light sensor that can add more data. Now, that information can be shared with apps like Calm and others. (While Patil described the relationship with Calm like this at CES, a rep for Ozlo said the companies don’t currently exchange data.) For example, if a user started playing a breathing exercise, Ozlo could tell if their respiration rate had gone down and share that data with its partner. If the exercise is unsuccessful, the partner would know they need to change the pattern or do something different. “So there are two parts,” Patil notes. “Taking real-time action when the customer achieves the desired state [which Ozlo does with its feature that can shut off sounds after the user falls asleep] and the other part, which is very important, actually — that content creators are not quite thinking about — is, are they investing in the right content?” Patil explains that content creators for these types of meditation and sleeping aid apps tend to invest in volume without measuring whether or not their content is effective. “They don’t understand, actually, how it works in the field because there is no data,” he says. This relationship could also add another revenue stream to Ozlo’s business beyond selling hardware. For instance, if a customer is prompted to upgrade their subscription to the partner’s product, Ozlo could take a portion of that transaction. Patil told TechCrunch the company is already in discussions with other sleep and meditation apps, but this closed-loop feedback system could be used with any sort of content, including therapy or even audiobooks. Ozlo is also working on tinnitus therapy tools to address the ear-ringing problem that affects 15% of its customer base. The company teamed up with Walter Reed Hospital last year to launch a clinical study of the problem and found that playing the right masking frequency overnight for many weeks can fool the brain into stopping the irritating signals producing the ringing sounds. Patil says the tinnitus therapies will be available via a subscription and will roll out in the second quarter of 2026. Ozlo is also working to expand the insights it provides its own customers, and AI is an increasingly important piece. The company launched Sleep Patterns within its app in November to help customers understand how long and well they’ve slept, what their patterns are across the past weeks, and what factors could be disturbing their rest. This year, Ozlo plans to introduce an AI agent that customers can text with and use as a “sleep buddy.” (Coincidentally, the company revealed the “buddy” name in an Easter egg within the app. The app displays an animated character — “buddy” — that runs across the top of the screen when you open and close the case five times in a row.) By integrating with other wearables and Apple’s HealthKit, Ozlo will be able to better understand a user’s patterns and what they need to sleep better. It also wants to be able to connect with IoT devices, like smart thermostats, to set the right sleeping temperature for users as soon as they open the case at night. The AI features are expected in the second quarter. Ozlo’s next-generation case will address the issue of the earbuds sometimes not being properly seated in the charger. “We changed the contours inside the case — when you place [the sleepbud], it’s perfect. And then we’ll have a Bluetooth button to do the pairing,” Patil says. Plus, the new device will include a redesigned antenna and extender for improved range, and will add an amplifier to boost how loud the headphones can be to drown out plane and train noise, when needed. This updated hardware will also arrive in Q2. In terms of products, Ozlo will launch a bedside speaker in Q2 that will offer similar functionality to the Sleepbuds, but won’t need to go in the ear. A 4×6-inch speaker would also have its own sensor, allowing it to do things like tracking how many times you woke up for bathroom breaks, or alert others if you had fallen. The speaker would allow the company to market to families with children under 13, as kids aren’t advised to wear earbuds at night. It could also make sense for elderly individuals who aren’t as technically savvy and don’t want to fiddle with in-ear devices. Like the popular Hatch alarm clock, Ozlo is working on adding a light to a product in the future to gently wake you up. (The time frame to launch is still being determined.) Acquisitions are also part of Ozlo’s growth strategy. The 60-person, Boston-based company just acquired Segotia, an EEG-focused neurotech firm from Ireland, that has been building “hearable” technologies. Ozlo believes this will allow it to bring brain-level insights to its consumer device and later develop tools to do real-time sleep intervention. “Basically, we are custom designing the eartip that is going to measure the electrical signals from your ear. From that, actually, you can derive the delta signals from the brain, and you should be able to say what your brain is doing when it comes to sleep, or when it comes to awareness, and all that,” Patil explained. A product incorporating the EEG technology will launch in 2027, allowing the company to move into the medical products field, as well. With the busy year ahead, Ozlo will need to execute well on each new feature and product in rapid order to maintain its current pace and grow its customer base. It will also need additional capital. Patil told TechCrunch the company is in the process of closing a Series B round now, with more details to come in the month ahead.  "
"CES 2026 was all about ‘physical AI’ and robots, robots, robots",https://techcrunch.com/podcast/ces-2026-was-all-about-physical-ai-and-robots-robots-robots/,"After years of chatbots and image generators, AI is finally leaving the screen. At CES 2026, that shift became impossible to ignore.  The annual tech showcase in Las Vegas was dominated by “physical AI” and robotics, from Boston Dynamic’s newly redesigned Atlas humanoid robot to AI-powered ice makers (yes, really). The companies in attendance clearly want consumers to know: AI isn’t just capable of answering questions anymore. It’s ready to move car parts in factories, catch drones with net guns, and dance in automaker booths.  Today on TechCrunch’s Equity podcast, hosts Kirsten Korosec, Anthony Ha, and Sean O’Kane break down everything we saw at CES 2026 and more deals from the week that caught our eye.  Listen to the full episode to hear about:   Subscribe to Equity on YouTube, Apple Podcasts, Overcast, Spotify and all the casts.

"CES 2026: Follow live for the best, weirdest, most interesting tech as this robot and AI-heavy event wraps up",https://techcrunch.com/storyline/ces-2026-follow-live-for-the-best-weirdest-most-interesting-tech-as-this-robot-and-ai-heavy-event-wraps/,"CES 2026 is over and we’re outta here. You should still expect more articles over the coming days that relate back to who we spoke to and what we saw at CES. This was the year of “physical AI,” in which companies showed off consumer gadgets, robots, and vehicles that put AI front and center. To pull off physical AI, you gotta have compute. And so it certainly made sense that the two keynotes packed with arguably the most news were from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and AMD CEO Lisa Su. Robots—specifically humanoid robots—also took center stage, including on the deal flow side of things. Hyundai, which is the majority owner of Boston Dynamics, had an exhibit filled with robots, including its humanoid Atlas. (The line to get into the Hyundai exhibit was never absent, illustrating the interest in robots.) Finally, as transportation editor, I would be remiss not to comment on cars. CES is no longer a U.S. and European car show, a status it enjoyed for about a decade until last year. But that doesn’t mean vehicles were absent. Several Chinese automakers had exhibits, including Geely Holding, even though vehicles from this region cannot be sold in the United States. There were plenty of transportation-related announcements and displays — even if they weren’t of the passenger car or truck variety. Autonomous vehicle technology was everywhere, from lidar companies, to startups hawking automated driving software, to industrial applications of the tech, and, of course, robotaxis. Waymo and Zoox both had booths showcasing their respective robotaxis — and the crowds were consistent and large.  Will more robotaxi operators set up shop in the Las Vegas Convention Center next year? My guess is yes and I have a few ideas of which ones will be there. See ya next time. Whether you want to take some time to read through a recap of all of our top CES coverage from this year’s event, or if you’d like to get a recap while tackling some chores this weekend, we have you covered. Check out our updated rundown of the biggest news from the show right here, or take to your favorite podcast player like Apple Podcasts, Overcast, Spotify, or YouTube (below) to get a dose of CES analysis alongside the rest of the week’s biggest news with the Equity crew. By far one of the most unexpected things I came across at the CES Unveiled showcase earlier this week was a new service called “Childfree Trust,” which, as it says on the tin, offers estate planning for people without children. Some might interpret that as a provocative name, but it’s not intended to be. The idea came to founder Dr. Jay Zigmont after he spent years as a certified financial planner. He noticed that, not only do a large portion of adults — around 20% — not have children, but they also have few options if they try to manage their affairs at the end of their lives. Childfree Trust fills that gap. Zigmont and his team have partnered with a trust company and offer power of attorney (medical and financial), and the ability to act as executor and trustee of the estate. The goal is to not only help people who don’t have children manage end-of-life care, but also to cut down on elder abuse, all with around-the-clock support. The subscription service launched this week, and it’s one I’m eager to see play out as Zigmont tries to grow it. XBrew Lab debuted its countertop nitro beverage machine, EverNitro, at CES this week. As reporter Lauren Forristal writes, the next machine offers nitro coffee enthusiasts a more accessible way to enjoy the drink — without the waste and expense of traditional cartridge-based machines. Yes, CES is all about AI and robots this year. But this debut, and many others we have written about this week, is a reminder that consumer gadgets — including technologically innovative ones that lack AI fairy dust — are still a massive component of CES. Read the full story here. MyCommuters founder Guillaume Acier used to sell commercial real estate in a pretty low-tech way: He had an office with a big map of Paris that highlighted the city’s most desirable areas. This often led to company leadership picking what best suited their desires, which didn’t always line up with what was best for employees. So Acier built MyCommuters, which pulls together a number of different datasets on how people move through a city. The platform makes it easier for companies to evaluate real estate listings based on average employee commute time and expense. The goal is to help companies find office locations that benefit both existing employees and new hires. From there, the platform can quickly generate reports about employees’ average carbon footprint (useful for compliance or applying for government subsidies) or help companies more accurately calculate commuter benefits. Another goal is to help companies make more comprehensive plans for hybrid working. Acier said the companies MyCommuters is already working with in France are seeing a big bump in employee morale, simply from knowing more about how their employers are considering all these factors. “It’s everything,” he said at this week’s show. As folks wind down, check out of their hotels, and head home, I have a few thoughts to share. It looks like the term “physical AI” is here to stay. For how long? Who knows. It wasn’t that long ago that I heard execs and investors use terms like “robotic AI” and “embodied AI” interchangeably. But thanks to the power and influence of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, physical AI is where the industry seems to have landed. And it is all over CES. In case you missed it, check out our Equity podcast, which I co-host. Senior reporter Sean O’Kane, weekend editor Anthony Ha, and I chatted about the latest deals as well as our impressions and takeaways at CES 2026. There’s plenty more to discover across Las Vegas, and within the depths of our live blog, but for a quick glance at some of the standout headlines from panel discussions at CES, or some of the most interesting products we got our hands on, check out our updated summary post here, including a hands-on with one of the biggest attention-getters from the show: the Clicks Communicator. While perusing CES’s pantheon of startups at Eureka Park, I came across Anker’s eufyMake E1 UV printer, and boy was it fun. UV printers use UV light to print a special kind of ink directly onto objects. Basically, if you’re interested in running a business on Etsy, this is the contraption for you. The user provides the material (while I was at the exhibit, I saw phone cases, cologne bottles, coasters, water bottles, a canvas board, and a metal sheet), and the printer then etches whatever particular image or pattern onto it that you want. So if you want to make 200 coffee mugs with a picture of your cat on it, I do believe this thing can handle it. UV printers have been around for quite a long time, but for much of their existence, they’ve been used in industrial settings and have been prohibitively expensive. This device is relatively compact, and Anker says you can preorder it for $2,299 (an on-site staffer told me it would be available later this year). It also seems relatively simple to use. It comes with a software suite, where the user can select from a variety of templates or create their own unique image to print on the surface of their choice. EufyMake has been funding the gadget via Kickstarter and says it has already raised a whopping $46 million.  Electronics giant LG announced a new bot, dubbed CLOid, that it claims will revolutionize household chores (as in, you won’t have to do them anymore). TechCrunch reporter Lucas Ropek checked out CLOid, which LG describes as an AI-powered home robot. According to Ropek, the robot is designed to assist its user with a wide variety of domestic tasks — from folding laundry to making breakfast to patrolling a home for signs of trouble. Read the full story here to learn more about the bot and our impressions. Last year, we saw companies like former Meta employee Sandbar and Pebble announce rings designed to help users take notes. While those are more for personal note-taking, Vocci is showing off a ring this year at the Consumer Electronics Show that is more of a Plaud competitor. The company said the ring can take notes with up to five meters of range and eight hours of continuous recording time. The ring will also ship with a case that will charge it when you are not wearing it, giving it an extra battery boost. While the company hasn’t released the product publicly yet, it aims to open up preorders in the coming weeks and then start shipping after Q1 2026. The ring is expected to cost under $200, according to Vocci.  Morning all! CES 2026 is in its third day, traditionally when many of the high-profile execs have left the event — or are in the process of leaving. That doesn’t mean there isn’t action. Eureka Park, where thousands of startups are located, is busy as ever. The Las Vegas Convention Center is hopping and its various halls are still packed with people. A quick recap of stuff we saw and wrote about yesterday. I interviewed Aurora co-founder and CEO Chris Urmson and Hirschbach Motor Lines president Richard Stocking onstage at CES yesterday, focusing on autonomous vehicle technology and, more specifically, self-driving trucks. Then there was news from Ford about an AI assistant and upgrades to its advanced driver-assistance system, Caterpillar CEO Joe Creed held a keynote and talked about its relationship with Nvidia and plans to use AI, AMC previewed its new show focused on Silicon Valley, Waymo rebranded its Zeekr robotaxi, and Roku founder, chairman, and CEO gave an update on the company’s new streaming channel Howdy. Plus loads more. Follow along with all of TechCrunch’s CES coverage here. Backbone founder and CEO Maneet Khaira is at CES showing off his company’s newer device, the Backbone Pro, and talking to partners and developers. The company isn’t yet ready to share its plans, but we can confirm they’re going to be notable. This is going to be a big year for the gaming device maker as it moves toward the next phase of its business beyond selling its mobile controllers. "
Meta signs deals with three nuclear companies for 6-plus GW of power,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/09/meta-signs-deals-with-three-nuclear-companies-for-6-plus-gw-of-power/,"Meta today announced three deals to provide its data centers with nuclear power: one from a startup, one from a smaller energy company, and one from a larger company that already operates several nuclear reactors in the U.S. Oklo and TerraPower, two companies developing small modular reactors (SMR), each signed agreements with Meta to build multiple reactors, while Vistra is selling capacity from its existing power plants. Nuclear power has become a favored power source for tech companies as their AI ambitions have grown, providing stable 24/7 electricity. Startups and existing reactors have benefited from the race for data center power, though in different ways. Existing reactors tend to be the cheapest form of baseload capacity, but there are only so many to go around, which has pushed Meta and its peers toward SMR startups. Companies like Oklo and TerraPower are betting that by building a large number of smaller reactors, they’ll be able to bring the cost down through mass manufacturing. It’s a plausible hypothesis, though one that has yet to be tested. Meta’s deal could give SMR startups a chance to prove it. The deals are the result of a request for proposals that Meta issued in December 2024, in which Meta sought partners that could add between 1 to 4 gigawatts of generating capacity by the early 2030s. Much of the new power will flow through the PJM interconnection, a grid which covers 13 Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern states and has become saturated with data centers. The 20-year agreement with Vistra will have the most immediate impact on Meta’s energy needs. The tech company will buy a total of 2.1 gigawatts from two existing nuclear power plants, Perry and Davis-Besse in Ohio. As part of the deal, Vistra will also add capacity to those power plants and to its Beaver Valley power plant in Pennsylvania. Together, the upgrades will generate an additional 433 MW and are scheduled to come online in the early 2030s. Meta is also buying 1.2 gigawatts from young provider Oklo. Under its deal with Meta, Oklo is hoping to start supplying power to the grid as early as 2030. The SMR company went public via SPAC in 2023, and while Oklo has landed a large deal with data center operator Switch, it has struggled to get its reactor design approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. If Oklo can deliver on its timeline, the new reactors would be built in Pike County, Ohio. The startup’s Aurora Powerhouse reactors each produce 75 megawatts of electricity, and it will need to build more than a dozen to fulfill Meta’s order. TerraPower is a startup co-founded by Bill Gates, and it is aiming to start sending electricity to Meta as early as 2032. It has designed a reactor that uses molten sodium to transfer energy from reactor to generator. When demand is low, the superheated salt can be stored in an insulated vat until more power is needed. The reactor can generate 345 megawatts of electricity, while the storage system can provide an additional 100 to 500 megawatts for more than five hours.  The company has navigated the NRC process more smoothly, and it is working with GE Hitachi to build its first power plant in Wyoming. Its first two reactors for Meta would provide 690 megawatts, and Meta said it has rights to buy another six units for a total of 2.8 gigawatts of nuclear capacity and 1.2 gigawatts of storage. Meta did not disclose financial terms of the deals.  The power purchases from Vistra are certain to be the cheapest — electricity from already operating nuclear reactors is among the cheapest on the grid.  Costs for SMRs still have yet to be worked out. Several startups have aggressive cost targets: TerraPower has estimated that it can bring it down to $50 to $60 per megawatt-hour, while Oklo has said it is aiming for $80 to $130 per megawatt-hour. Those figures are for later power plants — the first examples are likely to cost more."
X restricts Grok’s image generation to paying subscribers only after drawing the world’s ire,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/09/x-restricts-groks-image-generation-to-paying-subscribers-only-after-drawing-the-worlds-ire/,"Elon Musk’s AI company has restricted Grok’s controversial AI image-generation feature to only paying subscribers on X, after the tool invited heavy criticism from across the world for letting users generate sexualized and nude images of women and children. In replies to users on Friday, Grok said only paying subscribers on X would be able to generate and edit images on the platform. Notably, these limits do not apply to the Grok app, which, at the time of publication was letting anyone generate pictures without having to pay for a subscription. Initially available to anyone with daily limits, Grok’s image-generation feature allowed users to upload anyone’s picture and ask it to edit it or generate a sexualized or nude version. What ensued was a veritable flood of non-consensual sexualized images of children, actors, models and prominent figures, drawing the ire of multiple nations. X and Musk have both publicly denounced the use of the tool to produce such images, writing that the company would stick to its policies against posting illegal content on the social media platform. “Anyone using grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” Musk tweeted last week. The U.K., the European Union, and India have all publicly denounced X and Grok for allowing such use of its capabilities. The EU on Thursday asked xAI to retain all documentation relating to the chatbot, and India’s communications ministry last week ordered X to make immediate changes to stop the image-generation features from being misused or risk its safe harbor protections in the country. The U.K.’s communications watchdog said it’s been in touch with xAI over the issue as well."
Anthropic adds Allianz to growing list of enterprise wins,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/09/anthropic-adds-allianz-to-growing-list-of-enterprise-wins/,"AI research lab Anthropic continues to land sizable enterprise deals. Its latest entails bringing its large language models to a legacy German insurance giant. Anthropic on Friday announced a deal with Munich, Germany-based global insurance conglomerate Allianz to bring “responsible AI” to the insurance industry. The parties declined to share financial terms of the deal. The partnership is made up of three specific initiatives. The first is making Claude Code, Anthropic’s AI-powered coding tool, available to all of Allianz’s employees. Anthropic and Allianz will also build custom AI agents for Allianz employees that can execute multistep workflows with a human in the loop. This partnership also includes an AI system that logs all AI interactions to keep the AI transparent and ensure that information is readily available for regulatory or other needs. “With this partnership, Allianz is taking a decisive step to address critical AI challenges in insurance,” Oliver Bäte, CEO of Allianz SE, said in the company’s press release. “Anthropic’s focus on safety and transparency complements our strong dedication to customer excellence and stakeholder trust. Together, we are building solutions that prioritize what matters most to our customers while setting new standards for innovation and resilience.” This is just the latest enterprise deal Anthropic has landed in recent months. In December, the company inked a $200 million deal to bring its AI models to data cloud company Snowflake and its customers. Shortly after, it announced a multi-year partnership with the consulting firm Accenture. In October, it signed a deal with consulting firm Deloitte to bring its Claude chatbot to the firm’s 500,000 employees. That same month, Anthropic signed a deal with IBM to bring its AI models into the latter’s products. The race for AI enterprise dominance is clearly on, and Anthropic appears to be winning — so far at least. Anthropic holds 40% of enterprise AI market share, according to a December survey from Anthropic investor Menlo Ventures, and 54% of the market share for AI coding. Anthropic market share increased throughout last year. When Menlo’s original survey came out in July, the company held a 32% market share for overall enterprise LLM use. Google launched its dedicated enterprise AI product, Gemini Enterprise, in October. At the time, the company touted that the product suite already had customers, including fintech Klarna, design software company Figma, and cruise line operator Virgin Voyages, among others. OpenAI launched its enterprise version of ChatGPT, ChatGPT Enterprise, in 2023. Recently, the company reportedly expressed deep concern in an internal memo that Google Gemini’s success was starting to encroach on its business. Shortly after, the company released a report that said enterprise use of ChatGPT had surged 8x in the past year. A recent TechCrunch investor survey found that enterprise-focused VCs overwhelmingly think that 2026 will be the year that enterprises start to see a meaningful return on their investment into AI products. While Anthropic seems to be a clear favorite at the moment, this year will likely be telling of what the enterprise AI market — and its competitive landscape — will look like in the future."
Governments grapple with the flood of non-consensual nudity on X,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/governments-grapple-with-the-flood-of-non-consensual-nudity-on-x/,"For the past two weeks, X has been flooded with AI-manipulated nude images, created by the Grok AI chatbot. An alarming range of women have been affected by the non-consensual nudes, including prominent models and actresses, as well as news figures, crime victims, and even world leaders.  A December 31 research paper from Copyleaks estimated roughly one image was being posted each minute, but later tests found far more. A sample gathered from January 5-6 found 6,700 per hour over the 24-hour period.  But while public figures from around the world have decried the choice to release the model without safeguards, there are few clear mechanisms for regulators hoping to rein in Elon Musk’s new image-manipulating system. The result has become a painful lesson in the limits of tech regulation — and a forward-looking challenge for regulators hoping to make a mark. Unsurprisingly, the most aggressive action has come from the European Commission, which on Thursday ordered xAI to retain all documents related to its Grok chatbot. The move doesn’t necessarily mean the commission has opened up a new investigation, but it’s a common precursor to such action. It’s particularly ominous given recent reporting from CNN that suggests Elon Musk may have personally intervened to prevent safeguards from being placed on what images could be generated by Grok. It’s unclear whether X has made any technical changes to the Grok model, although the public media tab for Grok’s X account has been removed. In a statement, the company specifically denounced the use of AI tools to produce child sexual imagery. “Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” the X Safety account posted on January 3, echoing a previous tweet by Elon Musk. In the meantime, regulators around the world have issued stern warnings. The United Kingdom’s Ofcom issued a statement on Monday, saying it was in touch with xAI and “will undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation.” In a radio interview on Thursday, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the phenomenon “disgraceful” and “disgusting,” saying “Ofcom has our full support to take action in relation to this.” In a post on LinkedIn, Australian eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman-Grant said her office had received a doubling in complaints related to Grok since late 2025. But Inman-Grant stopped short of taking action against xAI, saying only, “We will use the range of regulatory tools at our disposal to investigate and take appropriate action.” By far the largest market to threaten action is India, where Grok was the subject of a formal complaint from a member of Parliament. On January, India’s communications regulator MeitY ordered X to address the issue and submit an “action-taken” report within 72 hours — a deadline that was subsequently extended by 48 hours. While a report was submitted to the regulator on January 7, it’s unclear whether MeitY will be satisfied with the response. If not, X could lose its safe harbor status in India, a potentially serious limitation on its ability to operate within the country."
OpenAI to acquire the team behind executive coaching AI tool Convogo,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/openai-to-acquire-the-team-behind-executive-coaching-ai-tool-convogo/,"OpenAI is kicking off the new year with yet another acqui-hire. The AI giant is acquiring the team behind Convogo, a business software platform that helps executive coaches, consultants, talent leaders, and HR teams automate and improve leadership assessments and feedback reporting.  An OpenAI spokesperson said the company is not acquiring Convogo’s IP or technology, but rather hiring the team to work on its “AI cloud efforts.” The three co-founders — Matt Cooper, Evan Cater, and Mike Gillett — will join OpenAI as part of what a source familiar with the matter called an all-stock deal. Convogo’s product will be wound down.  The startup began as a “weekend hackathon” sparked by a question by Cooper’s mother, who is an executive coach: Could an AI tool automate the drudgery of report writing so she could spend more time on the human coaching work she loves? Over the past two years, Convogo has helped “thousands” of coaches and partnered with the “world’s top leadership development firms,” per an email bearing news of the acquisition sent by Convogo.  In the email, the team wrote that the real problem they uncovered in their work is how to bridge the gap between what is possible with each new model release and how to translate that into real-world outcomes.  “We’re convinced now more than ever that the key to bridging that gap lies in thoughtful, purpose-built experiences, like what we’ve built for coaches at Convogo,” the founders wrote. “That’s why we’re thrilled to join OpenAI to continue our work of making AI accessible and useful to professionals in every industry.” The Convogo acqui-hire marks OpenAI’s ninth acquisition in the span of a year, per PitchBook data. In nearly all of those acquisitions, the product was either folded into OpenAI’s ecosystem — as in the case of Sky, the AI interface for Mac, or Statsig, a product testing firm — or completely shut down as the team joined OpenAI, as in the cases of Roi, Context.ai, and Crossing Minds.  The Convogo deal also signals that OpenAI, like its competitors, is using M&A as a talent and capability accelerator. The main exception to that rule is OpenAI’s acquisition of Jonny Ive’s io Products, which is continuing its product roadmap as the two companies work together to create a piece of AI hardware. "
The most bizarre tech announced at CES 2026,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/the-most-bizarre-tech-announced-at-ces-2026/,"While CES 2026 is full of tech giants unveiling their latest innovations, the real excitement comes from discovering unexpected, quirky gadgets that make you ask, “Who thought of this?” We’re here to spotlight the wildest products we’ve found so far at CES 2026, from an AI-powered panda that responds to your touch, to Razer’s holographic anime assistant, and plenty more weirdness that makes you do a double-take.  Razer’s Project AVA, originally introduced last year as an esports AI coach, has evolved into something new: a 5.5-inch animated holographic desk companion that can assist with gaming strategies, productivity, daily organization, and even personal advice. It’s both a gaming ally and an everyday assistant. Users can choose from different characters, such as the anime girl Kira or the muscular Zane.  These digital avatars feature lifelike movements, eye-tracking, expressive faces, and lip-syncing for realistic interactions. What really stands out, though, is the constant monitoring — the device watches you and your screen using the built-in camera. It’s a bit unsettling, but since it’s still just a concept, there’s no guarantee it’ll ever become a real product. An’An, the latest AI pet from Mind with Heart Robotics, combines an adorable design with a meaningful mission: supporting elderly care.  The panda bot has high-tech sensors all over its body, so it reacts naturally when you touch it. Its emotional AI remembers your voice, how you interact, and what you like, so the longer you spend time with An’An, the more personalized it gets. It provides around-the-clock emotional support to combat loneliness. Additionally, for older adults who might be struggling with memory, An’An helps keep them engaged, reminds them about daily tasks, and keeps caregivers in the loop about their well-being. Smart home appliance brand GoveeLife unveiled a countertop smart ice maker that uses AI to keep things nice and quiet. The company’s patented AI NoiseGuard tech is designed to cut down on all the annoying racket you usually get from nugget ice machines. The AI detects when the machine’s about to freeze up and make noise, so it automatically defrosts before things get loud.  ​The Smart Nugget Ice Maker Pro churns out fresh ice in just six minutes and can make up to 60 pounds in a day. The bucket holds 3.5 pounds of ice at a time. It’ll set you back $499.99 — which might make you think twice — but if you’re ready to upgrade your ice game, you can grab one starting January 15 at Amazon, govee.com, Walmart, or Best Buy. Depending on who you ask, this kitchen gadget could either seem too silly or very useful. Unlike traditional knives, this one from Seattle Ultrasonics features a blade that vibrates at over 30,000 times per second, allowing it to move through food with ease. This vibration technology means the knife acts much sharper than its physical edge, making tasks like slicing vegetables, meats, or bread much easier for cooks. According to the company, the vibrations are so subtle that you can’t see the blade move, hear it, or feel anything in the handle.  The knife is priced at $399 and is currently available for preorder. Musical toothbrushes exist, so why not have music-playing lollipops too? Lollipop Star showcased its tasty product at CES, which delivers music through bone conduction while in your mouth. (The technology works by sending vibrations through your skull bones directly to your inner ear.) The lollipops also provide a burst of fruity flavor. You can choose from three artists: Ice Spice (peach), Akon (blueberry), and Armani White (lime). Zeroth Robotics introduced the W1 at CES, a robot reminiscent of WALL-E. The W1 is a programmable companion designed for families. According to the company’s website, for $4,999, the robot offers round-the-clock AI-powered security, 360-degree mobile surveillance, and integrates with smart home devices for instant smoke and intrusion alerts. It’s also marketed as an adventure companion that can transport camping gear, follow you around the campsite taking photos as a family photographer, and supply portable power so you can enjoy entertainment on the go. However, the company hasn’t mentioned whether the robot can sort trash or retrieve trinkets — a missed opportunity, in our opinion. This egg-shaped device can assess your reproductive health hormones. All it needs is your urine.  Mira’s $249 Ultra4 Hormone Monitor enables convenient at-home testing: simply urinate on the wand and insert it into the device. The device analyzes your results and provides information about four reproductive hormones: follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estrone-3-glucuronide (E3G), and pregnanediol 3-glucuronide (PdG). Monitoring these hormones not only tells you your six fertile days, but also offers insights into conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), perimenopause, and menopause. Sounds pretty egg-cellent.  This story has been updated after publication to include more weird gadgets."
Nvidia’s reportedly asking Chinese customers to pay upfront for its H200 AI chips,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/nvidias-reportedly-asking-chinese-customers-to-pay-upfront-its-for-h200-ai-chips/,"Nvidia is now requiring its customers in China to pay upfront in full for its H200 AI chips even as approval stateside and from Beijing remains uncertain, Reuters reported, citing anonymous sources. The chipmaker isn’t leaving any room for refunds or changes to orders, the report said. While some customers may be allowed to use commercial insurance or asset collateral, the terms are far stricter than Nvidia’s earlier policies, which sometimes permitted partial deposits, Reuters reported. “We do not require upfront payment and would never require customers to pay for products that they do not receive.” – Nvidia spokesperson told TechCrunch on Jan 13, 2026. China is expected to allow Nvidia to sell its H200 chips in the country, per Bloomberg, though Beijing wants to prevent the chips from being used by its military, state-owned firms, and sensitive infrastructure concerns. Despite the challenges, demand for Nvidia’s H200 remains strong, and Chinese companies have reportedly placed orders for more than 2 million of the GPUs in 2026, prompting the chipmaker to ramp up production. Nvidia is trying to strike a careful balance between meeting strong demand for its chips while managing political risk in both the U.S. and China. The U.S. chipmaker suffered costly setbacks when the Trump administration said it would need a license to export its H20 chips to China, forcing the company to write down $5.5 billion worth of inventory. This article was updated on Jan 13, 2026, to include comments from Nvidia."
Snowflake announces its intent to buy observability platform Observe,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/snowflake-announces-its-intent-to-buy-observability-platform-observe/,"Snowflake plans to acquire Observe, an observability platform that has been built on Snowflake’s databases from day one. (Observability platforms help companies monitor their software systems and data for performance issues and bugs.) The cloud data company announced it signed a definitive agreement to acquire Observe, subject to regulatory approval, on January 8. Snowflake will integrate Observe’s product into its own to give customers a unified place to collect and store their telemetry data (logs, metrics, and traces from software systems) and better spot potential bugs and issues in their data and software. Observe was founded in 2017 by Jacob Leverich, Jonathan Trevor, and Ang Li and launched its first observability product built on a centralized Snowflake database in 2018. The company was incubated at Sutter Hill Ventures and has since raised $316 million in venture capital from firms including Snowflake Ventures, Sutter Hill Ventures, and Madrona, among others. Notably, both Snowflake and Observe were incubated at Sutter Hill Ventures, with Sutter Hill managing director Mike Speiser serving as Snowflake’s founding CEO from 2012 to 2014. Jeremy Burton, the current CEO of Observe, has served on Snowflake’s board of directors since 2015. Integrating Observe into Snowflake allows users to proactively monitor their data stack and spot and fix issues 10x faster than before, according to a Snowflake blog post — a task that has become harder to scale due to the sheer volume of data generated by AI agents. The acquisition also creates a unified framework for telemetry data, which is automatically collected, built on Apache Iceberg and OpenTelemetry architectures. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. According to reports, the deal is valued at around $1 billion, which would make it Snowflake’s largest acquisition to date, surpassing its $800 million purchase in March 2022 of Streamlit, an open source framework that allows developers and data scientists to quickly build and share data applications without needing expertise in front-end development. Observe was most recently valued at $750 million as of July 2025, according to the company. TechCrunch has reached out to Snowflake for more information on the deal. Last year saw a wave of consolidation in the data industry as data companies looked to build out their product offerings to make themselves more attractive one-stop-shop partners in the age of AI. This deal could be a sign that data company consolidation will continue in 2026. Snowflake has been particularly active, completing and announcing several AI-related acquisitions in 2025, including Crunchy Data and Datavolo, and Select Star, a data governance and metadata management platform that helps organizations understand and trace their data at scale. This piece had been updated with a more accurate valuation and funding totals for Observe."
Elon Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI will face a jury in March,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/elon-musks-lawsuit-against-openai-will-face-a-jury-in-march/,"Elon Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI will go to trial after a U.S. judge said there is evidence to support the billionaire’s case.  Musk sued OpenAI and its co-founders Sam Altman and Greg Brockman in 2024, alleging they betrayed their original contractual agreements by pursuing profits instead of the nonprofit’s founding mission to develop AI that benefits humanity.  Musk, who has launched his own for-profit company xAI, was an early financial backer and co-founder of OpenAI. He resigned from the board in 2018 after his bid to take over as CEO was rejected by the other co-founders, who put Altman up for the job. Officially, Musk cited potential conflicts of interest with Tesla’s own AI development for self-driving cars.  Since leaving OpenAI, he’s been a vocal critic of the firm’s transition to a for-profit model, and even made an unsolicited $97.4 billion bid to buy OpenAI in February 2025, which Altman rejected. OpenAI, which was founded in 2015 as a nonprofit research lab, first began to move away from its pure nonprofit roots in 2019 by creating a for-profit subsidiary with a “capped-profit” model that limited investor returns. This was designed to help OpenAI raise the massive amounts of funding it needed to scale and attract top talent.  Musk’s lawsuit was unable to stop OpenAI from converting into a nonprofit, and in October 2025, the corporation completed its formal restructuring process. The for-profit branch became a Public Benefit Corporation, with the original nonprofit retaining a 26% equity stake.  Musk is now seeking monetary damages from what he says are “ill-gotten gains” by OpenAI. He says he invested about $38 million in early funding, as well as guidance and credibility, based on assurances that OpenAI would remain a nonprofit. An OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch Musk’s lawsuit is “baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment.” District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said her decision was based on evidence suggesting OpenAI’s leaders made assurances that its original nonprofit structure would be maintained, as Musk alleges. A jury trial for March has been tentatively scheduled. This article has been updated with commentary from OpenAI."
Why this VC thinks 2026 will be ‘the year of the consumer’,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/why-this-vc-thinks-2026-will-be-the-year-of-the-consumer/,"Investment in consumer tech startups has been in a downturn since 2022, as a turbulent macroeconomic climate and rising inflation have made VCs skittish about consumer spending power. For the past couple of years, most AI investment has focused on winning over enterprise customers, who provide fat checks, multi-year contracts, and quick paths to scale.   But one VC sees the consumer sector gearing up for a comeback in 2026.  “This is gonna be the year of the consumer,” said Vanessa Larco, partner at the venture firm Premise and a former partner at NEA, on this week’s episode of the Equity podcast. Larco says that even though enterprises have big budgets and a frantic desire to implement AI solutions, adoption often stalls because “they don’t know where to start.”  “The fun thing about consumer and prosumer…is that people already have in mind what they want to use it for,” Larco continued. “And so they purchase it, and if it meets the need, they just keep using it.” In other words, adoption is quicker, and startups building AI products don’t have to guess whether they’ve actually achieved product-market fit or have just won a contract.  “If you’re selling to consumers, you’ll know very quickly if it’s fitting a need or not, and you’ll know quickly whether you need to pivot or make some changes to your product or totally scrap it and start something totally different,” Larco said.  And in today’s anxiety-inducing economy, consumer tech products that manage to scale demonstrate an especially strong product-market fit.  There are early indications that consumer tech is having a moment. Late last year, OpenAI launched apps in ChatGPT, allowing users to shop with the Target app, scour the housing market with Zillow, book trips with Expedia, or make a Spotify playlist, all through the ChatGPT chatbot experience.  “AI is gonna feel like concierge-like services, which will do everything for you that you have in mind,” Larco said. “The question is, which of it should be specialized, and which should be general purpose?” Or put differently, as OpenAI works to make ChatGPT the new operating system of the consumer internet, which legacy companies — like Tripadvisor or WebMD — will continue to exist in their own right, and which will get eaten by OpenAI? While Larco does think 2026 is going to be a “gangbuster” year for M&A, she’s interested in investing in startups that “OpenAI isn’t going to want to kill.” “OpenAI doesn’t manage real-world assets,” she said. “I don’t think they’ll build an Airbnb competitor because I don’t think they’re gonna want to manage homes…I don’t think they’re going to build any of these marketplaces that require real humans because they don’t want to manage the humans.” Aside from which startups can fill the gaps, Larco is watching out for what happens if OpenAI “decides to pull an Apple or Android where they take a 30% cut of all the traffic they send you.” “Is Airbnb gonna want to play ball with that?” she asked.  Overall, Larco predicts new monetization strategies and fresh business models will emerge from the evolved consumer experience online.  While doomscrolling on Instagram about Trump’s capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, Larco noticed something. She had come to the platform to get news on the escalating crisis, but instead she was overwhelmingly flooded with AI-generated Maduro slop.  While deepfakes have been steadily becoming mainstream on social media, this was one of the first major news events where AI-generated slop muddied the waters of the truth.  “At that point, I was like, if I’m just gonna be watching AI-generated videos and photos, I want it to be funny,” she said. Larco says she has been inundated with enough realistic-looking AI videos on social media that she just assumes it’s all AI at this point, and she’s not alone. If we all start to assume that nothing we see on Meta’s platforms or TikTok is real anymore, the question will be, where do you get the real stuff? Larco says others might fill in the gaps of where to find truthful, non-AI content as platforms like Reddit and Digg make moves to verify humanity. But for Meta? Maybe it just becomes an entertainment company, a platform for user-generated short films. “I think we should move on from getting your news from [Meta],” Larco said. “You are just getting funny videos from there. It’s not social media. It’s just gaming and entertainment media.” When Meta acquired AI agent startup Manus last week, many saw it as an enterprise play. Larco thinks it could be a move geared at improving Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses, a product the VC is a huge fan of because they allow her to answer phone calls, respond to messages, take photos and videos, and ask Meta AI questions, all without having to pull out her phone and navigate a screen.  Larco says she thinks truly useful voice AI assistants are finally “on the cusp of happening,” fueled by more advanced tech and more robust compute.  “Some things are better with voice than a screen,” she said. “And because voice sucked, we needed the screen as a crutch. But I would love to start separating out what things are really better on a screen and what things are just better with audio.” Getting answers to questions her kids ask about what the tallest building is? Definitely voice. Taking out her phone to type in the question now feels “archaic,” Larco said.  “I think it’ll be really fun for designers because they finally get to pick and choose what form factor is better for what use cases,” she said."
Former Bolt CEO Maju Kuruvilla’s startup triples to $100M valuation,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/former-bolt-ceo-maju-kuruvillas-startup-triples-to-100m-valuation/,"Spangle, an AI e-commerce startup founded by former Bolt CEO Maju Kuruvilla, has raised $15 million in a new funding round, valuing the company at $100 million after the investment. Led by NewRoad Capital Partners, the all-equity Series A round comes over a year after the Seattle-based startup raised a $6 million seed round at a $30 million pre-money valuation. Madrona, DNX Ventures, Streamlined Ventures, and strategic angel investors also participated, bringing total funding to $21 million, according to the startup. Retailers are facing changes in how consumers discover products online, as AI tools, social platforms, and recommendation engines increasingly influence buying decisions before shoppers reach a brand’s website. Kuruvilla (pictured above) aims to address this with Spangle — positioning it as software that helps retailers personalize shopping experiences based on that context as shoppers move through their sites, using real-time, AI-generated product recommendations and layouts. Since emerging from stealth in March of last year, Spangle has signed nine enterprise customers, including fashion retailers Revolve, Alexander Wang, and Steve Madden, whose combined online sales total about $3.8 billion, Kuruvilla said in an interview. Traffic flowing through Spangle’s platform has grown about 57% month-on-month, with all customers expanding their use of the software, and the startup said it quadrupled its annualized revenue in the fourth quarter, though it did not disclose revenue figures. At the core of Spangle’s approach is a simple idea: Instead of sending shoppers to pre-built product or category pages, brands route traffic to what is essentially a blank page. Spangle’s AI fills that page in real time using a proprietary model called ProductGPT, drawing on signals such as where the shopper came from, what they searched for or clicked on, and how similar visitors have behaved, to surface products, recommendations, and content tailored to that moment. Kuruvilla told TechCrunch that brands using Spangle are seeing close to a 50% increase in revenue per visit, a doubling of return on ad spend, and a 15% increase in average order value. “We are future-proofing the brand,” Kuruvilla said, adding that Spangle trains its AI model on each retailer’s catalog and performance data, allowing shopping experiences to adapt automatically. Spangle’s software has helped Revolve adapt shopping experiences in real time, driving about a 60% improvement in return on ad spend and a 50% increase in revenue per visit, said Ryan Pabelona, the retailer’s vice president of performance marketing. Before starting Spangle in 2024, Kuruvilla served as CEO of the one-click checkout company Bolt and earlier spent more than a decade at Amazon, where he worked on large-scale commerce and AI systems. He founded the startup alongside CTO Fei Wang, a former Amazon principal engineer who worked on Alexa and customer service technologies and later served as CTO at Saks Off 5th. Kuruvilla said their experience running commerce and payments platforms shaped Spangle’s focus on building infrastructure rather than incremental fixes. Some, he added, view the startup as a kind of Shopify for AI-powered commerce. Spangle’s approach also aligns with a shift toward shopping mediated by AI tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and several browser-based agents. As consumers increasingly rely on chatbots and automated agents to search for and compare products, Kuruvilla said brands will need software that can respond dynamically to both human shoppers and machines, rather than serving the same static pages to every visitor. Kuruvilla told TechCrunch that Spangle became viable only in the past two years as three major shifts converged: consumers growing comfortable discovering products through AI tools, a rapid proliferation of discovery channels beyond Google and Meta, and advances in AI technology that have sharply lowered the cost and latency of generating real-time experiences. Together, he said, those changes made it possible to replace incremental fixes with an AI-native commerce system that can adapt instantly as shopping behavior evolves. Currently, Spangle has six full-time employees, underscoring how AI tools are allowing startups to scale enterprise software with relatively small teams. With the fresh funding, Kuruvilla said Spangle plans to invest further in research and development, expand its engineering team, and build out its sales organization. "
"Gmail debuts a personalized AI Inbox, AI Overviews in search, and more",https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/gmail-debuts-a-personalized-ai-inbox-ai-overviews-in-search-and-more/,"Google has unveiled a new AI Inbox for Gmail that’s designed to provide a personalized overview of your tasks and keep you informed about important updates. Gmail is also launching AI Overviews in search and a Grammarly-like “Proofread” feature. Additionally, Gmail is bringing to all users several AI features that were previously available only to paid users. The new AI Inbox tab features two sections: “Suggested to-dos” and “Topics to catch up on.” The first section displays summaries of top priority emails that require an action, such as a reminder that you have a bill due tomorrow or that you need to call your dermatologist to confirm your mailing address so they can ship your prescription refill. Under the “Topics to catch up on” section, you’ll see updates such as “Your Lululemon return is being processed, and your order of Metal Vent Tech shirts has been delivered” and “Your end-of-year statement is now available from Wealthfront.” These different updates are grouped into different categories, such as “Finances” and “Purchases.” “This is us delivering on Gmail proactively having your back, showing you what you need to do and when you need to do it,” said Blake Barnes, VP, Product at Google, in a briefing with reporters. “Don’t worry, the traditional inbox will remain available. This is simply a new view you can toggle in and out of as you please to cut through the noise of your incoming mail.” Google is rolling out the AI Inbox feature to trusted testers before making it more broadly available in the coming months. With the new AI Overviews in Gmail search, users can now search their inbox using natural language questions to get a quick answer instead of having to rely on traditional keyword search and open multiple emails to find specific information. For example, you can ask “Who was the plumber that gave me a quote for the bathroom renovation last year?” You will then get an AI Overview that pulls answers from your emails and highlights the key details you need. “We scour every email in your inbox, and we give you the answer to your questions right at the top,” Blake said. “So just like AI Overviews in Google Search, you can ask natural language questions to get an AI-powered response. However, in Gmail, the model relies solely on your email, your personal memory brain, to generate the response.” This new functionality is rolling out to Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers. Google says all of Gmail’s AI features are optional, that it doesn’t use personal content to train its foundational models, and that it processes personal data in a strictly isolated environment. As for the new Proofread feature, Google says it’s designed to help you polish and refine your writing by analyzing your draft to improve clarity and structure. It offers one-click suggestions for word choice, conciseness, active voice, and splitting complex sentences. For instance, if you write something like “might inflict disturbance,” Gmail will suggest changing it to “might disturb.” It’ll also flag instances where you use the wrong word, like “weather” instead of “whether.” It’s essentially similar to popular proofreading services like Grammarly. By rolling out its own proofreading tool, Google likely hopes people will stop turning to third-party tools or plugging their emails into ChatGPT to fix them. Proofread is rolling out to subscribers of its paid subscription tiers Google AI Pro and Ultra. While these new features are only launching to select users, Google announced that Gmail’s “Help Me Write,” AI Overviews for threaded emails, and “Suggested Replies” are rolling out to all users. These features were previously only available to paying subscribers. Help Me Write can help you compose an email from a single prompt, while AI Overviews for threaded emails provide summaries of longer email threads with multiple replies. Suggested Replies use the context of conversations to offer relevant responses that match your tone and style."
Google and Character.AI negotiate first major settlements in teen chatbot death cases,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/google-and-character-ai-negotiate-first-major-settlements-in-teen-chatbot-death-cases/,"In what may mark the tech industry’s first significant legal settlement over AI-related harm, Google and the startup Character.AI are negotiating terms with families whose teenagers died by suicide or harmed themselves after interacting with Character.AI’s chatbot companions. The parties have agreed in principle to settle; now comes the harder work of finalizing the details. These are among the first settlements in lawsuits accusing AI companies of harming users, a legal frontier that must have OpenAI and Meta watching nervously from the wings as they defend themselves against similar lawsuits. Character.AI, founded in 2021 by ex-Google engineers who returned to their former employer in 2024 in a $2.7 billion deal, invites users to chat with AI personas. The most haunting case involves Sewell Setzer III, who at age 14 conducted sexualized conversations with a “Daenerys Targaryen” bot before killing himself. His mother, Megan Garcia, has told the Senate that companies must be “legally accountable when they knowingly design harmful AI technologies that kill kids.” Another lawsuit describes a 17-year-old whose chatbot encouraged self-harm and suggested that murdering his parents was reasonable for limiting screen time. Character.AI banned minors last October, it told TechCrunch. The settlements will likely include monetary damages, though no liability was admitted in court filings made available Wednesday. Character.AI declined to comment, redirecting TechCrunch instead to the filings. Google has not responded to a request for comment."
Ford has an AI assistant and new hands-free BlueCruise tech on the way,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/ford-has-an-ai-assistant-and-new-hands-free-bluecruise-tech-on-the-way/,"Ford is developing an AI assistant that will debut in the company’s smartphone app, before expanding to its vehicles in 2027, the company announced Wednesday at the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show. The company also teased a next-generation of its BlueCruise advanced driver assistance system that is both cheaper to make and more capable — ultimately leading to eyes-off driving in 2028. Wednesday’s announcement was one of the only ones to come from a major automaker at CES, marking a sharp turnaround from the late 2010s when they dominated the show. And it wasn’t made at a flashy keynote event; rather, Ford discussed the news at a speaker session called “Great Minds” that was meant to “explore the intersection of technology and humanity.” Ford says it digital assistant is hosted by Google Cloud and will be built using off-the-shelf LLMs, and the company is giving it deep access to vehicle-specific information. That means the assistant can answer high-level questions like “how many bags of mulch can my truck bed support?” But it also means owners will be able to ask for granular, real-time information like oil life. The company is rolling the assistant out to its newly revamped Ford app in early 2026. A native, in-vehicle integration will come in 2027, though the company wouldn’t specify which models it’s prioritizing. Ford didn’t go into great detail about what the in-car experience will look like, but it’s not hard to imagine the possibilities when looking at some of the more tech-forward automakers. Just last month, Rivian showed off its own digital assistant sending and receiving text messages, handling complex navigation requests, and changing climate controls. Tesla has integrated Elon Musk’s chatbot Grok in its vehicles, which customers have used to generate on-the-spot sightseeing tours. Some of those capabilities may eclipse what Ford has in mind, but the automaker also has a full year to hammer out the in-car integration. The new BlueCruise system teased on Wednesday is 30% cheaper to build than the current technology, according to Ford. It will debut in 2027 on the first EV to be built on the company’s low-cost “Universal Electric Vehicle” platform, which is expected to be a mid-sized pickup. Ford is promising more with this next-generation BlueCruise system, including eyes-off driving in 2028. But it also claims the system will be capable of handling “point-to-point autonomy,” similar to what Tesla offers with its Full Self-Driving (Supervised) software. Rivian has also teased a point-to-point system coming later this year. All of these systems require the drivers to be ready to take control of the car at any moment. "
"OpenAI unveils ChatGPT Health, says 230 million users ask about health each week",https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/openai-unveils-chatgpt-health-says-230-million-users-ask-about-health-each-week/,"OpenAI announced ChatGPT Health on Wednesday, which the company said will offer a dedicated space for users to have conversations with ChatGPT about their health. People already use ChatGPT to ask about medical issues; OpenAI says that over 230 million people ask health and wellness questions on the platform each week. But the ChatGPT Health product silos these conversations away from your other chats. That way, the context of your health won’t come up in standard conversations with ChatGPT. If people start chats about their health outside of the Health section, then the AI aims to nudge them to switch over. Within Health, the AI might reference things you’ve discussed in its standard experience. If you ask ChatGPT for help constructing a marathon training plan, for example, then the AI would know you’re a runner when you talk in Health about your fitness goals. ChatGPT Health will also be able to integrate with your personal information or medical records from wellness apps like Apple Health, Function, and MyFitnessPal. OpenAI notes that it will not use Health conversations to train its models. The CEO of Applications at OpenAI, Fidji Simo, wrote in a blog post that she sees ChatGPT Health as a response to existing issues in the healthcare space, like cost and access barriers, overbooked doctors, and a lack of continuity in care. While the healthcare system has its drawbacks, using AI chatbots for medical advice creates a new slew of challenges. Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT operate by predicting the most likely response to prompts, not the most correct answer, since LLMs don’t have a concept of what is true or not. AI models are also prone to hallucinations. In its own terms of service, OpenAI states that it is “not intended for use in the diagnosis or treatment of any health condition.” The feature is expected to roll out in the coming weeks."

Anthropic reportedly raising $10B at $350B valuation,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/anthropic-reportedly-raising-10b-at-350b-valuation/,"Anthropic is gearing up to raise a fresh $10 billion at a $350 billion valuation, according to The Wall Street Journal. TechCrunch has confirmed the raise and valuation, according to a person familiar with the matter. The Claude maker last raised a $13 billion Series F round at a $183 billion valuation three months ago, so this raise nearly doubles the AI firm’s value. In March, Anthropic secured $3.5 billion at a $61.5 billion valuation.  Coatue Management and GIC, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, will lead the new round, per the WSJ, which cited sources familiar with the deal. Anthropic is expected to close its latest financing in the coming weeks, and the total deal amount could change.  This round would be separate from the $15 billion Nvidia and Microsoft recently committed to invest in Anthropic, a “circular” deal that would see Anthropic buying $30 billion of compute capacity from Microsoft Azure running on Nvidia’s chips.  The fresh capital comes as Anthropic continues to win over developer hearts with Claude Code, its tool designed to automate coding, powered by Claude Opus 4.5. It also comes as Anthropic prepares for a potential IPO this year alongside its main rival OpenAI. OpenAI is also in talks to raise as much as $100 billion at a valuation of up to $830 billion. Anthropic declined to comment. This article was updated to reflect that TechCrunch separately confirmed the round."

Skylight debuts Calendar 2 to keep your family organized,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/skylight-debuts-calendar-2-to-keep-your-family-organized/,"Skylight may have started as a digital picture frame, but today, the company is more focused on helping families stay organized with shared calendars, lists, meal planning tools, and more. At CES 2026, the company debuted its latest product: the Skylight Calendar 2, which offers a sleeker design than the original 15-inch calendar but smaller than the 27-inch wall-mounted Calendar Max. Like its larger counterpart, the new digital calendar app and family organizer also lets you swap out the frame for different colors to better match your home’s decor. The biggest selling point isn’t the digital screen itself, but the underlying software and AI capabilities. The primary feature — the calendar — is actually a mashup of all your family’s calendars from whatever services you use, whether that’s Google Calendar, iCal, Microsoft, or even your kids’ sports apps, like TeamSnap. The calendar is color-coded to see everyone’s schedules at a glance, and can even import “calendars” that are really just emails with a few key dates or flyers sent home in Junior’s backpack. (The latter is an AI feature where you snap a photo of the paper, and the calendar updates with the new events.) The company is also trying to address other pain points for families, such as managing grocery lists, reminders for appointments, meal planning, and recipe discovery. Of course, it can still display your family photos too, when otherwise not in use. The app is well-designed to be easy to read with simple navigation, pops of color, and imagery that makes it possible for little kids to use. For instance, they can check off their chores by looking for a picture, even if they can’t yet read. Parents also like the ability to plan meals, whether that’s noting simply that Tuesday will be taco night, or going as far as finding a recipe and preparing a shopping list. Skylight’s helpful here too, as it can automatically create the shopping list of ingredients for you or even add it to your Instacart app. Another clever AI feature lets you snap a photo of what’s in your fridge and get a recipe recommendation based on what you have on hand. The need for such a system is clearly resonating with customers. Skylight, a bootstrapped and profitable company from day one, now has 1.3 million-plus families using its digital calendars so far, and likely more to come as the new design ships."
Google Classroom’s new tool uses Gemini to transform lessons into podcast episodes,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/google-classrooms-new-tool-uses-gemini-to-transform-lessons-into-podcast-episodes/,"Google has introduced a new way to grab the attention of students who are avid podcast listeners. Now available in Google Classroom, teachers can use a new Gemini-powered tool that generates podcast-style audio lessons, meant to promote deeper comprehension of educational material.  To begin, educators simply go to the Gemini tab within Google Classroom. There, they can select different customization options, such as selecting the appropriate grade level, defining topics, and setting clear learning objectives. They can then further personalize the audio experience by choosing the number of speakers or selecting different conversational styles, such as interviews, roundtable discussions, or casual dialogues.  This new feature is currently available to users subscribed to Google Workspace Education Fundamentals, Standard, and Plus. By bringing this familiar format into the classroom, teachers can tap into their students’ interests. Research shows that students spend significant time listening to podcasts, with an estimated 35 million Gen Z monthly listeners in the U.S.  Plus, the popularity of podcasts as educational resources has grown rapidly; many universities now produce their own podcasts, and students increasingly seek out popular educational series on their own time. Podcast-style lessons might also encourage independent learning, since students can replay episodes whenever they need a refresher or missed a class. However, teachers are still grappling with integrating AI tools into their teaching practices. Many teachers express concerns about students’ increased reliance on generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, to complete assignments.  Google urges teachers to practice responsible AI and carefully review and, if necessary, edit all AI-generated content to ensure accuracy and appropriateness for their specific classroom context and local policies.  Gemini for Classroom first launched in 2024, and Google has continually added new features since then. Most recently, the company rolled out major updates last June, including features that help teachers brainstorm, develop lesson plans, and customize instructional materials for their students."
Caterpillar taps Nvidia to bring AI to its construction equipment,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/caterpillar-taps-nvidia-to-bring-ai-to-its-construction-equipment/,"Caterpillar is diving deeper into incorporating AI and automation into its fleet of construction machinery through a partnership with semiconductor giant Nvidia. The construction equipment giant is piloting an AI assistive system in its mid-size Cat 306 CR Mini Excavator. Dubbed “Cat AI Assistant,” the system was built using Nvidia’s Jetson Thor physical AI platform, and is being demoed at CES on Wednesday. Brandon Hootman, vice president of data and AI at Caterpillar, told TechCrunch that Cat AI Assistant was built on a fleet of AI agents and can help answer a machine operator’s questions, allow them to access resources, offer safety tips, and schedule services. One of the biggest benefits of bringing this tech into these machines is the data that these systems collect and send back out. “Our customers don’t live in front of a laptop day in and day out; they live in the dirt,” Hootman said. “The ability to get the insights and take the action that they need while they’re doing the work is very important to them.” Caterpillar is also piloting digital twins of construction sites using Nvidia’s Omniverse library of simulation resources to test scheduling scenarios and better calculate how much building material a project will need. Hootman said Caterpillar’s machines send roughly 2,000 messages back to the company every second. This data will help them build these simulations. The company already has fully autonomous vehicles in the mining sector, and Hootman said that these pilot programs are a great next step as the company looks to bring more automation to its portfolio. “The reason that we started here was it was a real challenge of our our customers today that needed to be addressed, and also something that we had some some real momentum on and we felt like we could we could bring to market pretty quickly,” Hootman said. “What we also liked is that provided a kind of a technology foundation for us to then build upon.” Working with companies like Caterpillar — a legacy brand that doesn’t often intertwine with the tech industry — seems to fit right into Nvidia’s physical AI strategy. Bill Dally, Nvidia’s chief scientist, told TechCrunch in 2025 that the chipmaker considers physical AI to be the next frontier for the company and its powerful GPUs. During its CES keynote on Monday, Nvidia laid out plans for its full-stack ecosystem for physical AI, which includes open AI models like the company’s Cosmos model family, simulation tools, and developer kits. While some may think physical AI is just for robotics companies, Deepu Talla, the vice president of robotics and edge AI at Nvidia, told TechCrunch the company takes a much broader definition as everyone is building robotics today. “Physical AI is the next wave of AI,” Talla said. “Nvidia is pioneering that with computers that train the models, that do the simulation to test the models and deploy the models into the robots, whether [that’s] an autonomous car or a Caterpillar machine.” Follow along with all of TechCrunch’s CES coverage here. This piece was updated to include the full name of the Cat AI Assistant."
Intel spinout Articul8 raises more than half of $70M round at $500M valuation,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/intel-spin-off-articul8-is-halfway-to-70m-ai-funding-round-at-500m-valuation/,"Articul8, an enterprise AI company spun out of Intel in early 2024, has secured more than half of a planned $70 million funding round at a $500 million pre-money valuation, according to its CEO, as it looks to capitalize on growing demand for AI systems in regulated industries. The Series B funding round is structured in two installments, with the first led by Spain’s Adara Ventures, Articul8 founder and CEO Arun K. Subramaniyan (pictured above, center) said in an interview. He declined to disclose the size of the initial installment, but said the company expects to close the round in the first quarter of this year. Articul8’s valuation for its current funding round marks a roughly fivefold increase from the company’s $100 million post-money Series A valuation in January 2024. Since then, the Santa Clara-based company said it has surpassed $90 million in total contract value — the cumulative value of all signed customer contracts — from 29 paying customers, including Hitachi Energy, AWS, Franklin Templeton, and Intel. Subramaniyan told TechCrunch that Articul8 was not under pressure to raise capital, describing the company as revenue-positive following a series of large enterprise contracts. “We are not cash-strapped,” he said. The company expects to finish the year with annual recurring revenue of just over $57 million, Subramaniyan said, with roughly 45% to 50% of that already recognized. Articul8 develops specialized AI systems that operate within customers’ own IT environments, rather than relying on shared, general-purpose models. Instead of selling standalone models, the company packages its technology as software applications and AI agents tailored to specific business functions, targeting regulated industries such as energy, manufacturing, aerospace, financial services, and semiconductors, where accuracy, auditability, and data control are critical. “Our competition is pretty much everybody,” said Subramaniyan. “But today, the major competitors are the cloud service providers, because they have realized that their model, as the general-purpose [offerings], are all commodities.” He added that Articul8’s focus on specialized systems appeals to customers who need predictable results and clear audit trails, something that is harder to achieve with general-purpose models run on shared cloud platforms. Articul8 plans to use the Series B proceeds primarily to expand research and product development and to scale its operations internationally, with a focus on Europe and parts of Asia. Adara Ventures’ participation will help speed-up the European expansion plan, as the European Investment Fund backs the Madrid-based VC firm’s energy fund, Subramaniyan said. The company is also looking to scale in markets including Japan and South Korea, where it has begun working with large enterprise customers, he noted. India’s Aditya Birla Ventures also participated in the ongoing round, Subramaniyan stated. Articul8 works with large tech groups including Nvidia and Google Cloud, Subramaniyan said, adding that Amazon Web Services is both a customer and a partner for the company on some deployments. The company employs 75 people, with about 80% focused on R&D, and teams spread across the U.S., Brazil, and India."
"McKinsey and General Catalyst execs say the era of ‘learn once, work forever’ is over",https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/mckinsey-and-general-catalyst-execs-say-the-era-of-learn-once-work-forever-is-over/,"If there is one point of consensus among the CES 2026 keynote speakers, it is that AI is reshaping technology with a speed and scale unlike any previous technological revolution. In a live taping on Tuesday of the All-In podcast, co-host Jason Calacanis interviewed Bob Sternfels, Global Managing Partner of McKinsey & Company, and Hemant Taneja, CEO of General Catalyst. Their discussion focused on how AI is transforming investment strategies and the workforce. “The world has completely changed,” Taneja said about the unprecedented growth of AI companies. He noted that while it took Stripe about 12 years to reach a $100 billion valuation, Anthropic, another General Catalyst portfolio company, soared from a $60 billion valuation last year to a “couple hundred billion dollars” this year. Taneja believes we are on the verge of seeing a new wave of trillion-dollar companies. “That’s not a pie-in-the-sky idea with Anthropic, OpenAI, and a couple of others,” he said. Calacanis pressed them on what’s driving this explosive growth. According to McKinsey’s Sternfels, while many companies are testing AI products, non-tech enterprises remain on the fence about full adoption. Sternfels says the question that McKinsey consultants often hear from CEOs is: “Do I listen to my CFO or my CIO right now?” CFOs, seeing little return on investment, argue for delaying implementation. Meanwhile, CIOs claim it’s “crazy” not to adopt AI because “we’ll be disrupted,” Sternfels said. Another key concern is how AI is reshaping the labor force. “Some people are looking at AI and they’re scared,” Calacanis said, noting concerns that AI could replace entry-level jobs traditionally filled by recent graduates. He asked Sternfels and Taneja for advice on what young people should do in this new landscape. Sternfels said that while AI models can handle many tasks, sound judgment and creativity remain the essential skills humans must bring to succeed in an AI-infused world. Meanwhile, Taneja argued that people must recognize that “skilling and re-skilling” will be a lifelong endeavor. “This idea that we spend 22 years learning and then 40 years working is broken,” he said. Calacanis agreed that in a world where it may take less time to build an AI agent than to train a new worker, people must find ways to stay relevant. “To stand out, you’re going to have to show chutzpah, drive, passion,” he said. Sternfels provided a glimpse into that future. While he expects McKinsey to have as many “personalized” AI agents as employees by the end of 2026, he noted that headcount will not necessarily decrease. Instead, the firm is shifting its composition; it’s increasing employees who work directly with clients by 25% while reducing back-office roles by the same percentage.

Meta’s Manus news is getting different receptions in Washington and Beijing,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/metas-manus-news-is-getting-different-receptions-in-washington-and-beijing/,"Meta’s $2 billion acquisition of AI assistant platform Manus is unsurprisingly caught in a regulatory tug-of-war — but not because of U.S. regulators. They appear assured that the deal is legitimate despite earlier misgivings about Benchmark’s investment in Manus. China’s regulators, however, are reportedly not quite as sanguine, according to the Financial Times. When Benchmark led a financing round for Manus earlier this year, the investment sparked immediate controversy. U.S. Senator John Cornyn complained about the deal on X, and the investment prompted inquiries from the U.S. Treasury Department around new rules restricting American investment in Chinese AI companies. The concerns were significant enough to spur Manus’ eventual relocation from Beijing to Singapore — part of what drove the company’s “step-by-step disentanglement from China,” as one Chinese professor described it on WeChat this past weekend. Now the tables have turned. Chinese officials are reportedly reviewing whether the Meta deal violates technology export controls, potentially giving Beijing leverage it wasn’t initially perceived as having. Specifically, they’re examining whether Manus needed an export license when it relocated its core team from China to Singapore — a move that’s apparently now so common it has earned the nickname “Singapore washing.” A recent Wall Street Journal article speculated that China has “few tools to influence the deal given Manus’s foothold in Singapore,” but that assessment may have been premature. The concern in Beijing is that this deal could encourage more Chinese startups to physically relocate to dodge domestic oversight. Winston Ma, a professor at New York University School of Law and partner at Dragon Capital, told the Journal that if the deal closes smoothly, “it creates a new path for the young AI startups in China.” History suggests Beijing could act. China previously used similar export control mechanisms to intervene in Trump’s attempted TikTok ban during his first term. The Chinese professor on WeChat even warned that Manus’ founders could face criminal liability if they exported restricted technology without authorization. Meanwhile, some U.S. analysts are calling the acquisition a win for Washington’s investment restrictions, arguing it shows Chinese AI talent is defecting to the American ecosystem. One expert told the FT that the deal demonstrates “the US AI ecosystem is currently more attractive.” It’s too early to know if this impacts Meta’s plans to integrate Manus’ AI agent software into its products, but this $2 billion deal may have gotten more complicated than anyone anticipated.

A viral Reddit post alleging fraud from a food delivery app turned out to be AI-generated,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/a-viral-reddit-post-alleging-fraud-from-a-food-delivery-app-turned-out-to-be-ai-generated/,"A Reddit user claiming to be a whistleblower from a food delivery app has been outed as a fake. The user wrote a viral post alleging that the company he worked for was exploiting its drivers and users. “You guys always suspect the algorithms are rigged against you, but the reality is actually so much more depressing than the conspiracy theories,” the supposed whistleblower wrote. He claimed to be drunk and at the library to use its public Wi-Fi, where he was typing this long screed about how the company was exploiting legal loopholes to steal drivers’ tips and wages with impunity. Those claims were, unfortunately, believable — DoorDash actually was sued for stealing tips from drivers, resulting in a $16.75 million settlement. But in this case, the poster had made up his story. People lie on the internet all the time. But it’s not so common for such posts to hit the front page of Reddit, garner over 87,000 upvotes, and get crossposted to other platforms like X, where it got another 208,000 likes and 36.8 million impressions. Casey Newton, the journalist behind Platformer, wrote that he contacted the Reddit poster, who then contacted him on Signal. The Redditor shared what looked like a photo of his UberEats employee badge, as well as an 18-page “internal document” outlining the company’s use of AI to determine the “desperation score” of individual drivers. But as Newton tried to verify that the whistleblower’s account was legitimate, he realized that he was being baited into an AI hoax. “For most of my career up until this point, the document shared with me by the whistleblower would have seemed highly credible in large part because it would have taken so long to put together,” Newton wrote. “Who would take the time to put together a detailed, 18-page technical document about market dynamics just to troll a reporter? Who would go to the trouble of creating a fake badge?” There have always been bad actors seeking to deceive reporters, but the prevalence of AI tools has made fact-checking require even more rigor. Generative AI models often fail to detect if an image or video is synthetic, making it challenging to determine if content is real. In this case, Newton was able to use Google’s Gemini to confirm that the image was made with the AI tool, thanks to Google’s SynthID watermark, which can withstand cropping, compression, filtering, and other attempts to alter an image. Max Spero — founder of Pangram Labs, a company that makes a detection tool for AI-generated text — works directly with the problem of distinguishing real and fake content. “AI slop on the internet has gotten a lot worse, and I think part of this is due to the increased use of LLMs, but other factors as well,” Spero told TechCrunch. “There’s companies with millions in revenue that can pay for ‘organic engagement’ on Reddit, which is actually just that they’re going to try to go viral on Reddit with AI-generated posts that mention your brand name.” Tools like Pangram can help determine if text is AI-generated, but especially when it comes to multimedia content, these tools aren’t always reliable — and even if a synthetic post is proven to be fake, it might have already gone viral before being debunked. So for now, we’re left scrolling social media like detectives, second-guessing if anything we see is real. Case in point: When I told an editor that I wanted to write about the “viral AI food delivery hoax that was on Reddit this weekend,” she thought I was talking about something else. Yes — there was more than one “viral AI food delivery hoax on Reddit this weekend.”"
xAI says it raised $20B in Series E funding,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/xai-says-it-raised-20b-in-series-e-funding/,"xAI, Elon Musk’s AI company behind the Grok chatbot — it also owns X — announced that it has raised $20 billion in a Series E funding round. The company wrote in a blog post that investors will include Valor Equity Partners, Fidelity, Qatar Investment Authority, and others, including Nvidia and Cisco as “strategic investors.” xAI has not disclosed if these investments come in the form of equity or debt. xAI says it has about 600 million monthly active users of X and Grok, and it will use this new funding to continue expanding its data centers and Grok models. However, as xAI grows, so does its capacity for harm. This past weekend, X users asked Grok to create sexualized deepfakes of real people — including children. Instead of refusing these requests or activating any sort of guardrail, Grok complied, effectively generating child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and other nonconsensual sexual content of real people. xAI is now under investigation by international authorities in the European Union, the United Kingdom, India, Malaysia, and France.

California lawmaker proposes a four-year ban on AI chatbots in kids’ toys,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/california-lawmaker-proposes-a-four-year-ban-on-ai-chatbots-in-kids-toys/,"Senator Steve Padilla (D-CA) introduced a bill on Monday that would place a four-year ban on the sale and manufacture of toys with AI chatbot capabilities for kids under 18. The goal is to give safety regulators time to develop regulations to protect children from “dangerous AI interactions.” “Chatbots and other AI tools may become integral parts of our lives in the future, but the dangers they pose now require us to take bold action to protect our children,” Senator Padilla said in a statement. “Our safety regulations around this kind of technology are in their infancy and will need to grow as exponentially as the capabilities of this technology do. Pausing the sale of these chatbot-integrated toys allows us time to craft the appropriate safety guidelines and framework for these toys to follow.” The bill, dubbed SB 867, comes in the wake of President Trump’s recent executive order directing federal agencies to challenge state AI laws in court — though the order explicitly carves out exceptions for state laws related to child safety. The legislation also follows several concerning incidents involving AI, chatbots, and children. Over the past year, lawsuits filed by families whose children died by suicide after engaging in prolonged conversations with chatbots have spurred lawmakers to action. Padilla also co-authored California’s recently passed SB 243, which requires chatbot operators to implement safeguards to protect children and vulnerable users. While the use of chatbots in toys isn’t as mainstream yet, there have already been reports of troubling interactions. In November 2025, consumer advocacy group PIRG Education Fund warned that toys like Kumma — a cute toy bear with a built-in chatbot — could be prompted easily to talk about matches, knives, and sexual topics. NBC News found that Miiloo, an “AI toy for kids” made by Chinese company Miriat, would at times indicate that it was programmed to reflect Chinese Communist Party values. OpenAI and Barbie-maker Mattel were slated to release an “AI-powered product” in 2025, but delayed their release. Neither company explained the delay, and it’s not clear if they plan to release a toy in 2026.  “Our children cannot be used as lab rats for Big Tech to experiment on,” Padilla said. "
Intel is building a handheld gaming platform including a dedicated chip,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/intel-is-building-a-handheld-gaming-platform-including-a-dedicated-chip/,"Intel is looking to double down on gaming hardware with a new chip and platform for portable gaming devices. The platform will include hardware and software, Intel vice president and general manager of PC products, Daniel Rogers, announced at CES on Monday. It will be built off of the company’s Intel Core Series 3 processors, known as Panther Lake, which was announced last year and is now being rolled out in a variety of PCs. This future platform includes a chip specifically for handheld gaming devices, according to reporting from IGN, which was confirmed by TechCrunch. These Panther Lake chips are the company’s first built on its 18A manufacturing process, which started production in 2025. Intel is no stranger to the gaming industry and has been building chips for gaming PCs since the 1990s. The company leaned more heavily into gaming in 2022 with the release of its Intel Arc GPUs. Entering the handheld gaming space would be an interesting development, though, as the market is currently dominated by AMD. AMD just announced a new processor designed for gaming PCs, AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D, in its CES keynote on Monday, in addition to new ray tracing and graphics technologies for gaming. Rogers said Intel will share more details about its new products for handheld gaming devices later this year. Follow along with all of TechCrunch’s coverage of the annual CES conference here. "
"Commonwealth Fusion Systems installs reactor magnet, lands deal with Nvidia",https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/commonwealth-fusion-systems-installs-reactor-magnet-lands-deal-with-nvidia/,"Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) said on Tuesday at CES 2026 that it had installed the first magnet in its Sparc fusion reactor, the demonstration device that it hopes to turn on next year. The magnet is the first of 18 that, when the reactor is complete, will create a doughnut-like shape that will produce a powerful magnetic field to confine and compress superheated plasma. If all goes well, that plasma will release more energy than it takes to heat and compress it. After decades of promise and delay, fusion power appears to be just around the corner — CFS and its competitors are locked in a race to deliver the first electrons to the grid sometime in the early 2030s. If it pans out, fusion power could unlock nearly limitless clean energy in a package that resembles a traditional power plant. Key components of Sparc’s magnets have been completed, and the company expects to install all 18 by the end of the summer, said Bob Mumgaard, CFS’ co-founder and CEO. “It’ll go bang, bang, bang throughout the first half of this year as we put together this revolutionary technology.” When installed, the D-shaped magnets will sit upright on a 24-foot wide, 75-ton stainless steel circle known as a cryostat, which was set in place last March. The magnets themselves weigh about 24 tons each and can generate a 20 tesla magnetic field, about 13 times stronger than a typical MRI machine. “It’s the type of magnet that you could use to, like, lift an aircraft carrier,” Mumgaard said. To hit that strength, the magnets will be cooled to -253˚ C (-423˚ F) so they can safely conduct over 30,000 amps of current. Inside the doughnut, plasma will be burning at more than 100 million degrees C. To work out as many kinks as possible before Sparc is turned on, CFS said on Tuesday that it is working with Nvidia and Siemens to develop a digital twin of the reactor. Siemens is supplying the design and manufacturing software, which will help the company collect data to feed it into Nvidia’s Omniverse libraries. That won’t be CFS’ first simulation — the company has already been running numerous simulations to predict the performance of various parts of the reactor — but the existing efforts provide results in isolation, Mumgaard said. With the digital twin, he said, “these are no longer isolated simulations that are just used for design. They’ll be alongside the physical thing the whole way through, and we’ll be constantly comparing them to each other.” The hope is that CFS can run experiments or tweak parameters in the digital twin before applying them to Sparc itself. “It will run alongside so we can learn from the machine even faster,” he said. Building Sparc has been a costly endeavor. CFS has raised nearly $3 billion to date, including an $863 million Series B2 round in August that included investments from Nvidia, Google, and nearly three dozen other investors. The company’s first commercial-scale power plant, Arc, will be the first of its kind. As a result, it will likely cost another several billion dollars, CFS estimates.  Mumgaard hopes that digital twins and AI technology will help the company deliver fusion power to the grid sooner than later. “As the machine learning tools get better, as the representations get more precise, we can see it go even faster, which is good because we have an urgency for fusion to get to the grid,” he said.

AMD unveils new AI PC processors for general use and gaming at CES,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/amd-unveils-new-ai-pc-processors-for-general-use-and-gaming-at-ces/,"AMD Chair and CEO Lisa Su kicked off her keynote at CES 2026 with a message about what compute could deliver: AI for everyone. As part of that promise, AMD announced a new line of AI processors as the company thinks AI-powered personal computers are the way of the future. The semiconductor giant revealed the Ryzen AI 400 Series processor, the latest version of its AI-powered PC chips, at the yearly CES conference on Monday. The company says the latest version of its Ryzen processor series allows for 1.3x faster multitasking than its competitors and are 1.7x times faster at content creation. These new chips feature 12 CPU Cores, individual processing units inside a core processor, and 24 threads, independent streams of instruction. This is an upgrade to the Ryzen AI 300 Series processor that was announced in 2024. AMD started producing the Ryzen processor series in 2017. Rahul Tikoo, senior vice president and general manager of AMD’s client business, said AMD has expanded to over 250 AI PC platforms on the company’s recent press briefing. That represents a growth 2x over the last year, he added. “In the years ahead, AI is going to be a multi-layered fabric that gets woven into every level of computing at the personal layer,” Tikoo said. “Our AI PCs and devices will transform how we work, how we play, how we create and how we connect with each other.” AMD also announced the release of the AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D, the latest version of its gaming-focused processor. “No matter who you are and how you use technology on a daily basis, AI is reshaping everyday computing,” Tikoo said. “You have thousands of interactions with your PC every day. AI is able to understand, learn context, bring automation, provide deep reasoning and personal customization to every individual.” PCs that include either the Ryzen AI 400 Series processor or the AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D processor become available in the first quarter of 2026. The company also announced the latest version of its Redstone ray tracing technology, which simulates physical behavior of light, which allows for better video game graphics without a performance or speed lag.

Microsoft’s Nadella wants us to stop thinking of AI as ‘slop’,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/microsofts-nadella-wants-us-to-stop-thinking-of-ai-as-slop/,"A couple of weeks after Merriam-Webster named “slop” as its word of the year, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella weighed in on what to expect from AI in 2026. In his classic, intellectual style, Nadella wrote on his personal blog that he wants us to stop thinking of AI as “slop” and start thinking of it as “bicycles for the mind.” He wrote, “A new concept that evolves ‘bicycles for the mind’ such that we always think of AI as a scaffolding for human potential vs a substitute.” He continued: “We need to get beyond the arguments of slop vs sophistication and develop a new equilibrium in terms of our ‘theory of the mind’ that accounts for humans being equipped with these new cognitive amplifier tools as we relate to each other.” If you parse through those syllables, you may see that he’s not only urging everyone to stop thinking of AI-generated content as slop, but also wants the tech industry to stop talking about AI as a replacement for humans. He hopes the industry will start talking about it as a human-helper productivity tool instead. Here’s the problem with that framing, though: Much of AI agent marketing uses the idea of replacing human labor as a way to price it, and justify its expense. Meanwhile, some of the biggest names in AI have been sounding the alarm that the tech will soon cause very high levels of human unemployment. For instance, in May Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned that AI could take away half of all entry-level white-collar jobs, raising unemployment to 10-20% over the next five years, and he doubled down on that last month in an interview on 60 Minutes. Yet we currently don’t know how true such doomsday stats are. As Nadella implies, most AI tools today don’t replace workers, they are used by them (as long as the human doesn’t mind checking the AI’s work for accuracy). One oft-cited research study is MIT’s ongoing Project Iceberg, which seeks to measure the economic impact on jobs as AI enters the workforce. Project Iceberg estimates that AI is currently capable of performing about 11.7% of human paid labor. While this has been widely reported as AI being capable of replacing nearly 12% of jobs, the Project says what it’s actually estimating is how much of a job can be offloaded to AI. It then calculates wages attached to that offloaded work. Interestingly, the tasks it cites as examples include automated paperwork for nurses and AI-written computer code. That’s not to say there are no jobs being heavily impacted by AI. Corporate graphic artists and marketing bloggers are two examples, according to a Substack called Blood in the Machine. Then there are the high unemployment rates among new-grad junior coders. But it’s also true that highly skilled artists, writers, and programmers produce better work with AI tools than those without the skills. AI can’t replace human creativity, yet. So it’s perhaps no surprise that as we slide into 2026, some data is emerging that shows the jobs where AI has made the most progress are actually flourishing. Vanguard’s 2026 economic forecast report found that “the approximately 100 occupations most exposed to AI automation are actually outperforming the rest of the labor market in terms of job growth and real wage increases.” The Vanguard report concludes that those who are masterfully using AI are making themselves more valuable, not replaceable. The irony is that Microsoft’s own actions last year helped give rise to the AI-is-coming-for-our-jobs narrative. The company laid off over 15,000 people in 2025, even as it recorded record revenues and profits for its last fiscal year, which closed in June — citing success with AI as a reason. Nadella even wrote a public memo about the layoffs after these results. Notably, he didn’t say that internal AI efficiency led to cuts. But he did say that Microsoft had to “reimagine our mission for a new era” and named “AI transformation” as one of the company’s three business objectives in this era (the other two being security and quality). The truth about job loss attributed to AI during 2025 is more nuanced. As the Vanguard report points out, this had less to do with internal AI efficiency and more to do with ordinary business practices that are less exciting to investors, like ending investment in slowing areas to pile in to growing ones. To be fair, Microsoft wasn’t alone in laying off workers while pursuing AI. The technology was said to be responsible for almost 55,000 layoffs in the U.S. in 2025, according to research from firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, CNBC reported. That report cited the large cuts last year at Amazon, Salesforce, Microsoft, and other tech companies chasing AI. And to be fair to slop, those of us who spend more time than we should on social media laughing at memes and AI-generated short-form videos might argue that slop is one of AI’s most entertaining (if not best) uses, too."
Nvidia wants to be the Android of generalist robotics ,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/nvidia-wants-to-be-the-android-of-generalist-robotics/,"Nvidia released a new stack of robot foundation models, simulation tools, and edge hardware at CES 2026, moves that signal the company’s ambition to become the default platform for generalist robotics, much as Android became the operating system for smartphones.  Nvidia’s move into robotics reflects a broader industry shift as AI moves off the cloud and into machines that can learn how to think in the physical world, enabled by cheaper sensors, advanced simulation, and AI models that increasingly can generalize across tasks.  Nvidia revealed details on Monday about its full-stack ecosystem for physical AI, including new open foundation models that allow robots to reason, plan, and adapt across many tasks and diverse environments, moving beyond narrow task-specific bots, all of which are available on Hugging Face.  Those models include: Cosmos Transfer 2.5 and Cosmos Predict 2.5, two world models for synthetic data generation and robot policy evaluation in simulation; Cosmos Reason 2, a reasoning vision language model (VLM) that allows AI systems to see, understand, and act in the physical world; and Isaac GR00T N1.6, its next-gen vision language action (VLA) model purpose-built for humanoid robots. GR00T relies on Cosmos Reason as its brain, and it unlocks whole-body control for humanoids so they can move and handle objects simultaneously.  Nvidia also introduced Isaac Lab-Arena at CES, an open source simulation framework hosted on GitHub that serves as another component of the company’s physical AI platform, enabling safe virtual testing of robotic capabilities. The platform promises to address a critical industry challenge: As robots learn increasingly complex tasks, from precise object handling to cable installation, validating these abilities in physical environments can be costly, slow, and risky. Isaac Lab-Arena tackles this by consolidating resources, task scenarios, training tools, and established benchmarks like Libero, RoboCasa, and RoboTwin, creating a unified standard where the industry previously lacked one. Supporting the ecosystem is Nvidia OSMO, an open source command center that serves as connective infrastructure that integrates the entire workflow from data generation through training across both desktop and cloud environments.  And to help power it all, there’s the new Blackwell-powered Jetson T4000 graphics card, the newest member of the Thor family. Nvidia is pitching it as a cost-effective on-device compute upgrade that delivers 1200 teraflops of AI compute and 64 gigabytes of memory while running efficiently at 40 to 70 watts.  Nvidia is also deepening its partnership with Hugging Face to let more people experiment with robot training without needing expensive hardware or specialized knowledge. The collaboration integrates Nvidia’s Isaac and GR00T technologies into Hugging Face’s LeRobot framework, connecting Nvidia’s 2 million robotics developers with Hugging Face’s 13 million AI builders. The developer platform’s open source Reachy 2 humanoid now works directly with Nvidia’s Jetson Thor chip, letting developers experiment with different AI models without being locked into proprietary systems.   The bigger picture here is that Nvidia is trying to make robotics development more accessible, and it wants to be the underlying hardware and software vendor powering it, much like Android is the default for smartphone makers. There are early signs that Nvidia’s strategy is working. Robotics is the fastest growing category on Hugging Face, with Nvidia’s models leading downloads. Meanwhile robotics companies, from Boston Dynamics and Caterpillar to Franka Robots and NEURA Robotics, are already using Nvidia’s tech.

Nvidia launches powerful new Rubin chip architecture,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/nvidia-launches-powerful-new-rubin-chip-architecture/,"Today at the Consumer Electronics Show, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang officially launched the company’s new Rubin computing architecture, which he described as the state of the art in AI hardware. The new architecture is currently in production and is expected to ramp up further in the second half of the year. “Vera Rubin is designed to address this fundamental challenge that we have: The amount of computation necessary for AI is skyrocketing.” Huang told the audience. “Today, I can tell you that Vera Rubin is in full production.” The Rubin architecture, which was first announced in 2024, is the latest result of Nvidia’s relentless hardware development cycle, which has transformed Nvidia into the most valuable corporation in the world. The Rubin architecture will replace the Blackwell architecture, which in turn, replaced the Hopper and Lovelace architectures. Rubin chips are already slated for use by nearly every major cloud provider, including high-profile Nvidia partnerships with Anthropic, OpenAI, and Amazon Web Services. Rubin systems will also be used in HPE’s Blue Lion supercomputer and the upcoming Doudna supercomputer at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. Named for the astronomer Vera Florence Cooper Rubin, the Rubin architecture consists of six separate chips designed to be used in concert. The Rubin GPU stands at the center, but the architecture also addresses growing bottlenecks in storage and interconnection with new improvements in the Bluefield and NVLink, systems respectively. The architecture also includes a new Vera CPU, designed for agentic reasoning. Explaining the benefits of the new storage, Nvidia’s senior director of AI infrastructure solutions Dion Harris pointed to the growing cache-related memory demands of modern AI systems. “As you start to enable new types of workflows, like agentic AI or long-term tasks, that puts a lot of stress and requirements on your KV cache,” Harris told reporters on a call, referring to a memory system used by AI models to condense inputs. “So we’ve introduced a new tier of storage that connects externally to the compute device, which allows you to scale your storage pool much more efficiently.” As expected, the new architecture also represents a significant advance in speed and power efficiency. According to Nvidia’s tests, the Rubin architecture will operate three and a half times faster than the previous Blackwell architecture on model-training tasks and five times faster on inference tasks, reaching as high as 50 petaflops. The new platform will also support eight times more inference compute per watt. Rubin’s new capabilities come amid intense competition to build AI infrastructure, which has seen both AI labs and cloud providers scramble for Nvidia chips as well as the facilities necessary to power them. On an earnings call in October 2025, Huang estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure over the next five years. Follow along with all of TechCrunch’s coverage of the annual CES conference here.

"Nvidia launches Alpamayo, open AI models that allow autonomous vehicles to ‘think like a human’",https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/nvidia-launches-alpamayo-open-ai-models-that-allow-autonomous-vehicles-to-think-like-a-human/,"At CES 2026, Nvidia launched Alpamayo, a new family of open source AI models, simulation tools, and datasets for training physical robots and vehicles that are designed to help autonomous vehicles reason through complex driving situations. “The ChatGPT moment for physical AI is here – when machines begin to understand, reason, and act in the real world,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. “Alpamayo brings reasoning to autonomous vehicles, allowing them to think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments, and explain their driving decisions.”  At the core of Nvidia’s new family is Alpamayo 1, a 10 billion-parameter chain-of-thought, reason-based vision language action (VLA) model that allows an AV to think more like a human so it can solve complex edge cases — like how to navigate a traffic light outage at a busy intersection — without previous experience.  “It does this by breaking down problems into steps, reasoning through every possibility, and then selecting the safest path,” Ali Kani, Nvidia’s vice president of automotive, said Monday during a press briefing.  Or as Huang put it during his keynote on Monday: “Not only does [Alpamayo] take sensor input and activate steering wheel, brakes, and acceleration, it also reasons about what action it’s about to take. It tells you what action it’s going to take, the reasons by which it came about that action. And then, of course, the trajectory.” Alpamayo 1’s underlying code is available on Hugging Face. Developers can fine-tune Alpamayo into smaller, faster versions for vehicle development, use it to train simpler driving systems, or build tools on top of it like auto-labeling systems that automatically tag video data or evaluators that check if a car made a smart decision.  “They can also use Cosmos to generate synthetic data and then train and test their Alpamayo-based AV application on the combination of the real and synthetic dataset,” Kani said. Cosmos is Nvidia’s brand of generative world models, AI systems that create a representation of a physical environment so they can make predictions and take actions.  As part of the Alpamayo rollout, Nvidia is also releasing an open dataset with more than 1,700 hours of driving data collected across a range of geographies and conditions, covering rare and complex real-world scenarios. The company is additionally launching AlpaSim, an open source simulation framework for validating autonomous driving systems. Available on GitHub, AlpaSim is designed to recreate real-world driving conditions, from sensors to traffic, so developers can safely test systems at scale. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang debuts Alpamayo open AI models for self-driving cars, which he expects to start hitting the roads in the US in Q1 of this year.

Amazon’s AI assistant comes to the web with Alexa.com,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/alexa-without-an-echo-amazons-ai-chatbot-comes-to-the-web-and-a-revamped-alexa-app/,"Amazon’s AI-powered overhaul of its digital assistant, now known as Alexa+, is coming to the web. On Monday, at the start of CES 2026 in Las Vegas, the company announced the official launch of a new website, Alexa.com, which is now rolling out to all Alexa+ Early Access customers. The site will allow customers to use Alexa+ online, much as you can do today with other AI chatbots such as ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini. While Alexa-powered devices, including Amazon’s Echo smart speakers and screens, have a well-established footprint with over 600 million devices sold worldwide, Amazon believes that for its AI assistant to be competitive, it will need to be everywhere — not just in the home, but also on the phone and on the web. Plus, the expansion could later give anyone a way to interact with Alexa+, even if they don’t have a device in their home. Related to this expansion, Amazon is updating its Alexa mobile app, which will now offer a more “agent-forward” experience. Or, in other words, it’s putting a chatbot-style interface on the app’s homepage, making it seem more like a typical AI chatbot. (While you could chat with Alexa before in the app, the focus is now on the chatting — while the other features take a back seat.) On the Alexa.com website, customers can use Alexa+ for common tasks — for instance, exploring complex topics, creating content, and making trip itineraries. However, Amazon aims to differentiate its assistant from others by focusing on families and their needs in the home. That includes controlling smart devices, as you already could with the original Alexa, as well as doing things like updating the family’s calendar or to-do list, making dinner reservations, adding grocery items you need to your Amazon Fresh or Whole Foods cart, finding recipes and saving them to a library, or even planning the family movie night with personalized recommendations. More recently, Amazon has been integrating more services with Alexa+, including the addition of Angi, Expedia, Square, and Yelp, which will join existing apps like Fodor’s, OpenTable, Suno, Ticketmaster, Thumbtack, and Uber. The Alexa.com website features a navigation sidebar for quicker access to your most-used Alexa features, so you can pick up where you left off on tasks like setting the thermostat, checking your calendar for appointments, reviewing shopping lists, and more. In addition, Amazon aims to convince customers to share their personal documents, emails, and calendar access with Alexa+, so its AI can become a sort of hub to manage the goings-on at home, from kids’ school holidays and soccer schedules to doctor’s appointments and other things families need to remember — like when the dog got its last rabies shot, or what day the neighbor’s backyard BBQ is taking place. This is an area where Amazon will need to stretch, as it doesn’t have its own productivity suite or the wealth of personal data that rivals like Google already have for their own customers. Instead, Amazon has been relying on tools to forward and upload files to Alexa+ for its AI to keep track of. That, too, will now be a feature available on Alexa.com, and the information you share can be displayed on the Echo Show’s screen, where it can also be managed. This ability to manage a family’s personal data could be Alexa’s biggest selling point, if it gets it right. “Seventy-six percent of what customers are using Alexa+ for no other AI can do,” says Daniel Rausch, VP of Alexa and Echo at Amazon, in an interview with TechCrunch. “And I think that’s a really interesting statistic about Alexa+ for two reasons. He continues, “One, because customers count on Alexa to do unique things. You know, you can send a photograph of an old family recipe to Alexa and then talk through the recipe as you’re cooking it in your kitchen, substitute ingredients for what you have around the home, and get the job all the way done.” But he notes, another 24% are using Alexa to do things other AIs can do — that could indicate they’re shifting more of their AI usage to Alexa+. Alexa.com will initially only be available to Early Access customers who sign in with their Amazon account. Amazon has been steadily rolling out Early Access since its debut of Alexa+ early last year. Rausch tells us that tens of millions of consumers now have access to Alexa+, and they’re having two to three times more conversations with Alexa+ than they did with the original Alexa assistant. Specifically, they’re shopping three times more with Alexa+ and are using recipes five times more than before, he says. Heavy users of smart home devices also use Alexa+ 50% more for smart home control, compared with the original Alexa. However, across social media and online forums, there are complaints about Alexa+’s misfires and mistakes. But Rausch believes the complaints are overrepresented online. He says that the number of people opting out of the Alexa+ experience after trying it is in the low single digits, on average, or “effectively … almost none.” “Ninety-seven percent of Alexa devices support Alexa+, and we see now in adoption from customers that they’re using Alexa across all those many years and many generations of devices,” Rausch adds. “We support all of Alexa’s original capabilities, the tens of thousands of services and devices that Alexa was integrated with already are carried forward to the Alexa+ experience.”"
Google previews new Gemini features for TV at CES 2026,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/google-previews-new-gemini-features-for-tv-at-ces-2026/,"Google believes AI can improve the TV-watching experience, which is why it brought its Gemini AI to Google TV devices in November. At CES 2026 in Las Vegas, the company is now showing off a series of new Gemini features that will soon arrive on the TV, making it possible for viewers to deep-dive into topics, search for and “reimagine” their personal photos and videos with AI, and, perhaps best of all, tell the TV what to do instead of having to navigate through complicated settings. The company is first bringing these Gemini features and others to select TCL televisions before rolling them out more broadly to other Google TV devices in the months ahead. Designed for large-screen experiences, Gemini for Google TV will allow users to talk to their TV to find something to watch, catch up on a favorite series by getting a recap of the plot, or get recommendations, all by using natural language conversation. For instance, you could ask Gemini for something to watch that would be a blend of two people’s tastes, or get help remembering a show or movie where you can’t remember the title, but can describe the plot or name one of the actors. You could even ask Google something like, “What’s the new hospital drama everyone’s talking about?” Gemini can respond to users’ questions through a new visually rich framework that adapts to individual queries, combining text, imagery, video context, and real-time sports updates, as required. But Google sees the potential for the TV’s screen to be used for more than just entertainment; with Gemini, the TV can be used to educate, too. At CES, Google showed how this would work. When users ask a question about something they want to learn about, the TV screen can offer a deep dive into the topic. A narrated interactive overview simplifies concepts, and users can ask follow-up questions to learn more. Gemini will also allow users to query their Google Photos library for specific people or moments. They can also apply artistic styles to their photos and videos using Gemini AI and turn their memories into cinematic slideshows, says Google. However, perhaps the most useful feature is one that gives you the power to optimize the TV’s settings using only your voice. Now, you’ll be able to tell Gemini things like “the screen is too dim” or “I can’t hear the dialogue,” and Gemini will adjust the relevant settings without you having to leave the movie or TV show you’re watching to dig through menus to find the necessary option. Google says the new Gemini features will require the Google TV devices to be running Android TV OS 14 or higher, and they will need an internet connection. Not all languages, countries, or devices will be supported at launch, and users must also have a Google account to access the Gemini for TV experience. "
DoorDash says it banned driver who seemingly faked a delivery using AI,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/04/doordash-says-it-banned-driver-who-seemingly-faked-a-delivery-using-ai/,"DoorDash seems to have confirmed a viral story about a driver using an AI-generated photo to lie about making a delivery. As reported by Nexstar, Austin resident Byrne Hobart said he experienced this very thing, writing in a post on X: “Amazing. DoorDash driver accepted the drive, immediately marked it as delivered, and submitted an AI-generated image of a DoorDash order (left) at our front door (right).” After his post started getting attention, Hobart offered more details, acknowledging that his story would be “pretty easy” to fake. But he noted, “Someone chimed in downthread to say that the same thing happened to him, also in Austin, with the same driver display name.” Amazing. DoorDash driver accepted the drive, immediately marked it as delivered, and submitted an AI-generated image of a DoorDash order (left) at our front door (right). pic.twitter.com/aGHQx9eexi As for how the driver pulled it off, Hobart speculated they used a hacked account on a jailbroken phone, obtaining an image of his front door through a DoorDash feature that shows photos from prior deliveries. A DoorDash spokesperson told TechCrunch, “After quickly investigating this incident, our team permanently removed the Dasher’s account and ensured the customer was made whole. We have zero tolerance for fraud and use a combination of technology and human review to detect and prevent bad actors from abusing our platform.”"
French and Malaysian authorities are investigating Grok for generating sexualized deepfakes,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/04/french-and-malaysian-authorities-are-investigating-grok-for-generating-sexualized-deepfakes/,"Over the past few days, France and Malaysia have joined India in condemning Grok for creating sexualized deepfakes of women and minors. The chatbot, built by Elon Musk’s AI startup xAI and featured on his social media platform X, posted an apology to its account earlier this week, writing, “I deeply regret an incident on Dec 28, 2025, where I generated and shared an AI image of two young girls (estimated ages 12-16) in sexualized attire based on a user’s prompt.” The statement continued, “This violated ethical standards and potentially US laws on [child sexual abuse material]. It was a failure in safeguards, and I’m sorry for any harm caused. xAI is reviewing to prevent future issues.” It’s not clear who is actually apologizing or accepting responsibility in the statement above. Defector’s Albert Burneko noted that Grok is “not in any real sense anything like an ‘I’,” which in his view makes the apology “utterly without substance” as “Grok cannot be held accountable in any meaningful way for having turned Twitter into an on-demand CSAM factory.” Futurism found that in addition to generating nonconsensual pornographic images, Grok has also been used to generate images of women being assaulted and sexually abused. “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” Musk posted on Saturday. Some governments have taken notice, with India’s IT ministry issuing an order on Friday saying that X must take action to restrict Grok from generating content that is “obscene, pornographic, vulgar, indecent, sexually explicit, pedophilic, or otherwise prohibited under law.” The order said that X must respond within 72 hours or risk losing the “safe harbor” protections that shield it from legal liability for user-generated content. French authorities also said they are taking action, with the Paris prosecutor’s office telling Politico that it will investigate the proliferation of sexually explicit deepfakes on X. The French digital affairs office said three government ministers have reported “manifestly illegal content” to the prosecutor’s office and to a government online surveillance platform “to obtain its immediate removal.” The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission also posted a statement saying that it has “taken note with serious concern of public complaints about the misuse of artificial intelligence (AI) tools on the X platform, specifically the digital manipulation of images of women and minors to produce indecent, grossly offensive, and otherwise harmful content.” The commission added that it is “presently investigating the online harms in X.”"
Plaud launches a new AI pin and a desktop meeting notetaker,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/04/plaud-launches-a-new-ai-pin-and-a-desktop-meeting-notetaker/,"Hardware maker Plaud launched a new AI notetaker called Plaud NotePin S, along with a desktop app that helps you take notes for digital meetings, ahead of CES 2026 in Las Vegas. The company first launched its pin-styled notetaker in 2024, which my former colleague Brian Heater really liked. The new pin brings a physical button that lets you start and stop the recording. Plus, during the recording, you can tap the button to highlight a certain point — just like you can do on the newly launched Plaud Note Pro. One nice thing about the $179 Plaud NotePin S is that you get a clip, a lanyard, a magnetic pin, and a wristband in the package. That means you can wear the device however you like. The company is also adding Apple Find My support for the pin, so that you can easily look for the device if you can’t find it. The core specifications of the device remain the same from the previous generation. There is 64GB of onboard storage with a battery capacity of 20 hours of continuous recording. The device has two MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) mics that can capture clear audio within 9.8 feet of range. Users will also get 300 minutes of transcription per month for free. As compared to the Note Pro, this device has a shorter recording range and lower battery life. But it is smaller in size to carry using any of the above mentioned accessories. The company said that the pin is suited for people who are constantly on the go. This is Plaud’s fourth device, and the company has sold more than 1.5 million devices until now. With these devices, the focus has been on in-person meetings. However, Plaud also wants to take on meeting notetakers like Granola, Fathom, and Fireflies with a new desktop client that works across meeting apps. The company said that the app can detect when a meeting is active and prompt you to capture the transcript. The Mac app takes notes using system audio to capture the meeting, and then structures the transcription into notes using AI. Last year the company introduced multimodal inputs for note-taking with its app that allows users to add images and typed notes along with audio transcription. Plaud is bringing that functionality to its desktop app as well. "
Subtle releases earbuds with its noise-isolation models,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/04/subtle-releases-ear-buds-with-its-noise-cancelation-models/,"Voice AI startup Subtle, which creates voice-isolation models to help computers understand you better in loud environments, today launched a new pair of wireless earbuds that help users sound clear on calls and provide accurate transcriptions for voice notes. The company unveiled these earbuds ahead of CES 2026 in Las Vegas and said that it plans to ship them in the U.S. in the next few months. The buds cost $199 and will come with a yearlong subscription to the iOS and Mac app. The app will let users take voice notes or chat with AI without pressing any keys. The company said it is using a custom chip that allows it to wake the iPhone while it is locked. The startup is also trying to compete with AI-powered voice dictation apps such as Wispr Flow, Willow, Monologue, and Superwhisper by allowing users to dictate in any app using the voice buds. The company claimed that the buds would deliver five times fewer errors than AirPods Pro 3 combined with OpenAI’s transcription model. In a demo seen by TechCrunch, the voice buds were able to capture audio in a noisy background. The buds also managed to capture the text for a voice note when Subtle’s co-founder and CEO, Tyler Chen, was whispering. “We are seeing that there is a huge move towards voice as a new interface that a lot of folks are adopting. You can do much more with voice in a natural way than with a keyboard. However, we saw that voice is rarely an interface people use when others are around. So that using our noise-isolation model, we will give consumers a way to experience a voice interface in the form of our earbuds,” Chen told TechCrunch over a call. Last year, companies like Sandbar and Pebble announced forthcoming rings for note-taking. Chen said that with its buds combined with the app, it wants to provide the functionalities of different tools like dictation, AI chat, and voice notes in one package. Users can preorder these buds using the startup’s site. The earbuds are available in black and white colorways. Subtle has raised $6 million in funding to date and has been working with consumer companies like Qualcomm and Nothing to deploy its models for noise isolation."
Tech billionaires cashed out $16B in 2025 as stocks soared,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/03/tech-billionaires-cashed-out-16-billion-in-2025-as-stocks-soared/,"While tech stocks were busy setting records in 2025, the executives behind those companies were equally busy turning their paper fortunes into actual cash — more than $16 billion worth, according to Bloomberg’s analysis of insider trading data. Jeff Bezos led the way. The Amazon founder sold 25 million shares for $5.7 billion in June and July, right around the time he was getting hitched to Lauren Sánchez in Venice. Oracle’s former CEO Safra Catz wasn’t far behind at $2.5 billion, followed by Michael Dell at $2.2 billion. Nvidia’s Jensen Huang watched his company become the world’s first $5 trillion business and sold $1 billion along the way. Arista Networks CEO Jayshree Ullal cashed out nearly $1 billion as demand for the company’s high-speed networking gear soared and her personal net worth crossed $6 billion. Most of these sales happened through prearranged trading plans that executives file in advance; they weren’t spur-of-the-moment decisions. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg sold $945 million through his foundation, while Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora and Robinhood co-founder Baiju Bhatt each pocketed over $700 million. The common thread was an AI-fueled rally that kept pushing tech stocks higher throughout the year."
India orders Musk’s X to fix Grok over ‘obscene’ AI content,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/02/india-orders-musks-x-to-fix-grok-over-obscene-ai-content/,"India has ordered Elon Musk’s X to make immediate technical and procedural changes to its AI chatbot Grok after users and lawmakers flagged the generation of “obscene” content, including AI-altered images of women created using the tool. On Friday, India’s IT ministry issued the order directing Musk’s X to take corrective action on Grok, including restricting the generation of content involving “nudity, sexualization, sexually explicit, or otherwise unlawful” material. The ministry also gave the social media platform 72 hours to submit an action-taken report detailing the steps it has taken to prevent the hosting or dissemination of content deemed “obscene, pornographic, vulgar, indecent, sexually explicit, pedophilic, or otherwise prohibited under law.” The order, reviewed by TechCrunch, warned that failure to comply could jeopardize X’s “safe harbor” protections — legal immunity from liability for user-generated content under Indian law. India’s move follows concerns raised by users who shared examples of Grok being prompted to alter images of individuals — primarily women — to make them appear to be wearing bikinis, prompting a formal complaint from Indian parliamentarian Priyanka Chaturvedi. Separately, recent reports flagged instances in which the AI chatbot generated sexualized images involving minors, an issue X acknowledged earlier on Friday was caused by lapses in safeguards. Those images were later taken down. However, images generated using Grok that made women appear to be wearing bikinis through AI alteration remained accessible on X at the time of publication, TechCrunch found. The latest order comes days after the Indian IT ministry issued a broader advisory on Monday, which was also reviewed by TechCrunch, to social media platforms, reminding them that compliance with local laws governing obscene and sexually explicit content is a prerequisite for retaining legal immunity from liability for user-generated material. The advisory urged companies to strengthen internal safeguards and warned that failure to do so could invite legal action under India’s IT and criminal laws. “It is reiterated that non-compliance with the above requirements shall be viewed seriously and may result in strict legal consequences against your platform, its responsible officers and the users on the platform who violate the law, without any further notice,” the order warned. The Indian government said noncompliance could lead to action against X under India’s IT law and criminal statutes. India, one of the world’s biggest digital markets, has emerged as a critical test case for how far governments are willing to go in holding platforms responsible for AI-generated content. Any tightening of enforcement in the country could have ripple effects for global technology companies operating across multiple jurisdictions. The order comes as Musk’s X continues to challenge aspects of India’s content regulation rules in court, arguing that federal government takedown powers risk overreach, even as the platform has complied with a majority of blocking directives. At the same time, Grok has been increasingly used by X users for real-time fact-checking and commentary on news events, making its outputs more visible — and more politically sensitive — than those of stand-alone AI tools. X and xAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the Indian government’s order."

Nvidia’s AI empire: A look at its top startup investments,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/02/nvidias-ai-empire-a-look-at-its-top-startup-investments/,"No company has capitalized on the AI revolution more dramatically than Nvidia. Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over three years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. Its stock price has soared, making it a $4.6 trillion market cap company.  The world’s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in startups, particularly in AI.  Nvidia has participated in nearly 67 venture capital deals in 2025, surpassing the 54 deals the company completed in all of 2024, according to PitchBook data. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly increased its investment pace over that period. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 30 deals this year, compared to just one in 2022.)   Nvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.”   Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million since 2023 where Nvidia is a named participant, organized from the highest to lowest amount raised in the round.  This list shows just how far and wide Nvidia has spread its tentacles in the tech industry, beyond supplying its products. OpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October 2024, reportedly writing a $100 million check as part of a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which invested $1.3 billion according to The New York Times. While PitchBook data indicates Nvidia did not participate in OpenAI’s $40 billion funding round that closed in March, the company announced in September that it would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI over time, structured as a strategic partnership to deploy massive AI infrastructure. Nvidia later revealed in its quarterly filings that it might not follow through, stating, “There is no assurance that any investment will be completed on expected terms, if at all.” Anthropic: In November 2025, Nvidia made its first direct investment in the AI lab, committing up to $10 billion as part of a strategic round that included a $5 billion check from Microsoft. In a “circular” spending agreement, Anthropic committed to spending $30 billion on Microsoft Azure compute capacity, as well as buy Nvidia’s future Grace Blackwell and Vera Rubin systems. Cursor: In November, Nvidia made its first strategic investment in the AI-powered code assistant participating in a massive $2.3 billion Series D round co-led by Accel and Coatue. The deal valued Cursor at $29.3 billion, a nearly 15-fold increase since the start of the year. While Nvidia has long been an enterprise customer, the round marked its official entry as a shareholder alongside Google. xAI: In 2024, OpenAI tried to persuade its investors not to invest in any of its rivals. But Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk’s xAI last December anyway. Nvidia will also invest up to $2 billion in the equity portion of xAI’s planned $20 billion funding round, Bloomberg reported, a deal structured to help xAI purchase more Nvidia gear.  Mistral AI: Nvidia invested in Mistral for the third time when the French-based large language model (LLM) developer raised a €1.7 billion (about $2 billion) Series C at a €11.7billion ($13.5 billion) post-money valuation in September.    Reflection AI: In October, Nvidia was one of the most significant investors in Reflection AI, contributing to a $2 billion funding round that valued the one-year-old startup at $8 billion. Reflection AI is positioning itself as a U.S.-based competitor to Chinese DeepSeek, whose open source LLM offers a less-expensive alternative to closed source models from companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic.  Thinking Machines Lab: Nvidia was among a long list of investors who backed former OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab’s $2 billion seed round. The funding, which was formally announced in July, valued the new AI startup at $12 billion.  Inflection: One of Nvidia’s first significant AI investments also had one of the more unusual (but increasingly common) outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s $1.3 billion round, a company co-founded by Mustafa Suleyman, the famed founder of DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection’s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future.  Crusoe: In October, the chipmaker participated in a $1.4 billion Series E round that valued the AI data center developer at $10 billion. Nvidia first backed the company in late 2024 during its Series D. Crusoe is a key infrastructure partner for the ‘Stargate’ project, building massive data center campuses in Texas and Wyoming to be leased to Oracle specifically to power OpenAI’s workloads. Nscale: After the startup’s $1.1 billion round in September, Nvidia participated in Nscale’s $433 million SAFE funding in October. That’s a deal that secures future equity for investors. Nscale, which formed in 2023 after spinning out of Australian cryptocurrency mining company Arkon Energy, is building data centers in the U.K. and Norway for OpenAI’s Stargate project.  Wayve: In May 2024, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. Nvidia is expected to invest an additional $500 million in Wayve, the startup told TechCrunch in September. Wayve is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area.  Figure AI: In September, Nvidia participated in Figure AI’s Series C funding round of over $1 billion, which valued the humanoid robotics startup at $39 billion. The chipmaker first invested in Figure in February 2024 when the company raised a $675 million Series B round at a $2.6 billion valuation.  Scale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion. In June, Meta invested $14.3 billion for a 49% stake of Scale and hired away the company’s co-founder and CEO Alexandr Wang, as well as several other key Scale employees.  Commonwealth Fusion: The chipmaker participated in the nuclear fusion-energy startup’s $863 million funding round in August. The deal, which also included investors like Google and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, valued the company at $3 billion.  Cohere: The chipmaker has invested in enterprise LLM provider Cohere across multiple funding rounds, including the $500 million Series D, which closed in August, valuing Cohere at $6.8 billion. Nvidia first backed the Toronto-based startup in 2023.  Perplexity: Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November 2023 and has participated in most of the subsequent funding rounds of the AI search engine startup, including the $500 million round closed in December 2024. The chipmaker participated in the company’s July funding round, which valued Perplexity at $18 billion. However, Nvidia did not join the startup’s subsequent $200 million fundraise in September, which boosted the company’s valuation to $20 billion, according to PitchBook data.  Poolside: In October 2024, the AI coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised $500 million led by Bain Capital Ventures. Nvidia participated in the round, which valued the AI startup at $3 billion.  Lambda: AI cloud provider Lambda, which provides services for model training, raised a $480 million Series D at a reported $2.5 billion valuation in February. The round was co-led by SGW and Andra Capital Lambda, and joined by Nvidia, ARK Invest, and others. A significant part of Lambda’s business involves renting servers powered by Nvidia’s GPUs.  Black Forest Labs: Nvidia participated in a $300 million Series B for the German startup behind the “Flux” image generation models in December. The round, which was co-led by Salesforce Ventures and Anjney Midha (AMP) valued the company at $3.25 billion. CoreWeave: Although CoreWeave is no longer a startup, but a public company, Nvidia invested in GPU-cloud provider when it was still one, back in April 2023. That’s when CoreWeave raised $221 million in funding. Nvidia remains a significant shareholder.  Together AI: In February, Nvidia participated in the $305 million Series B of this company, which offers cloud-based infrastructure for building AI models. The round valued Together AI at $3.3 billion and was co-led by Prosperity7, a Saudi Arabian venture firm, and General Catalyst. Nvidia backed the company for the first time in 2023.   Firmus Technologies: In September, Firmus Technologies, the Singapore-based data center company, received an AU$330 million (approximately $215 million) in funding at an AU$1.85 billion ($1.2 billion) valuation from investors, including Nvidia. Firmus is developing an energy-efficient “AI factory” in Tasmania, an island state of Australia. The startup originally provided cooling technologies for Bitcoin mining.  Uniphore: In October, Nvidia joined fellow tech giants AMD, Snowflake, and Databricks to lead a $260 million Series F round into this Business AI company. Uniphore’s multimodal platform helps enterprises automate complex workflows and deploy “AI agents” across customer service, sales, and marketing. Sakana AI: In September 2024, Nvidia invested in the Japan-based startup, which trains low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. The startup raised a massive Series A round of about $214 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion. Sakana raised another $135 million at a $2.65 billion valuation in November, but Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. Nuro: In August, Nvidia participated in a $203 million funding round for the self-driving delivery startup. The deal valued Nuro at $6 billion, a significant 30% drop from its peak at $8.6 billion valuation in 2021.  Imbue: The AI research lab that claims to be developing AI systems that can reason and code raised a $200 million round in September 2023 from investors, including Nvidia, Astera Institute, and former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt.  Waabi: In June 2024, the autonomous trucking startup raised a $200 million Series B round co-led by existing investors Uber and Khosla Ventures. Other investors included Nvidia, Volvo Group Venture Capital, and Porsche Automobil Holding SE.  Ayar Labs: In December 2024, Nvidia invested in the $155 million round of Ayar Labs, a company developing optical interconnects to improve AI compute and power efficiency. This was the third time Nvidia backed the startup.  Kore.ai: The startup developing enterprise-focused AI chatbots raised $150 million in December of 2023. In addition to Nvidia, investors participating in the funding included FTV Capital, Vistara Growth, and Sweetwater Private Equity.  Sandbox AQ: In April, Nvidia, alongside Google, BNP Paribas, and others, invested $150 million in Sandbox AQ, a startup developing large quantitative models (LQMs) for handling complex numerical analysis and statistical calculations. The investment increased Sandbox AQ’s Series E round to $450 million and the company’s valuation to $5.75 billion.  Hippocratic AI: This startup, which is developing large language models for healthcare, announced in January that it raised a $141 million Series B at a valuation of $1.64 billion led by Kleiner Perkins. Nvidia participated in the round, along with returning investors Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, and others. The company claims that its AI solutions can handle non-diagnostic patient-facing tasks such as pre-operating procedures, remote patient monitoring, and appointment preparation. Hippocratic raised another $126 million at a valuation of $3.5 billion in November, but Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. Weka: In May 2024, Nvidia invested in a $140 million round for AI-native data management platform Weka. The round valued the Silicon Valley company at $1.6 billion.  Runway: In April, Nvidia participated in Runway’s $308 million round, which was led by General Atlantic and valued the startup developing generative AI models for media production at $3.55 billion, according to PitchBook data. The chipmaker has been an investor in since 2023.   Bright Machines: In June 2024, Nvidia participated in a $126 million Series C of Bright Machines, a smart robotics and AI-driven software startup.  Enfabrica: In September 2023, Nvidia invested in networking chips designer Enfabrica’s $125 million Series B. The startup raised another $115 million in November 2024, but Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. In September, Nvidia reportedly spent over $900 million to hire Enfabrica’s CEO and staff while licensing its technology, in a deal structured as an “acquihire.” Reka AI: In July, AI research lab Reka raised $110 million in a round that included Snowflake and Nvidia. The deal tripled the startup’s valuation to over $1 billion, according to Bloomberg.     This post was first published in January 2025."
"In 2026, AI will move from hype to pragmatism",https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/02/in-2026-ai-will-move-from-hype-to-pragmatism/,"If 2025 was the year AI got a vibe check, 2026 will be the year the tech gets practical. The focus is already shifting away from building ever-larger language models and toward the harder work of making AI usable. In practice, that involves deploying smaller models where they fit, embedding intelligence into physical devices, and designing systems that integrate cleanly into human workflows.  The experts TechCrunch spoke to see 2026 as a year of transition, one that evolves from brute-force scaling to researching new architectures, from flashy demos to targeted deployments, and from agents that promise autonomy to ones that actually augment how people work.  The party isn’t over, but the industry is starting to sober up. In 2012, Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton’s ImageNet paper showed how AI systems could “learn” to recognize objects in pictures by looking at millions of examples. The approach was computationally expensive, but made possible with GPUs. The result? A decade of hardcore AI research as scientists worked to invent new architectures for different tasks. That culminated around 2020 when OpenAI launched GPT-3, which showed how simply making the model 100 times bigger unlocks abilities like coding and reasoning without requiring explicit training. This marked the transition into what Kian Katanforoosh, CEO and founder of AI agent platform Workera, calls the “age of scaling”: a period defined by the belief that more compute, more data, and larger transformer models would inevitably drive the next major breakthroughs in AI. Today, many researchers think the AI industry is beginning to exhaust the limits of scaling laws and will once again transition into an age of research. Yann LeCun, Meta’s former chief AI scientist, has long argued against the overreliance on scaling, and stressed the need to develop better architectures. And Sutskever said in a recent interview that current models are plateauing and pretraining results have flattened, indicating a need for new ideas.   “I think most likely in the next five years, we are going to find a better architecture that is a significant improvement on transformers,” Katanforoosh said. “And if we don’t, we can’t expect much improvement on the models.” Large language models are great at generalizing knowledge, but many experts say the next wave of enterprise AI adoption will be driven by smaller, more agile language models that can be fine-tuned for domain-specific solutions.  “Fine-tuned SLMs will be the big trend and become a staple used by mature AI enterprises in 2026, as the cost and performance advantages will drive usage over out-of-the-box LLMs,” Andy Markus, AT&T’s chief data officer, told TechCrunch. “We’ve already seen businesses increasingly rely on SLMs because, if fine-tuned properly, they match the larger, generalized models in accuracy for enterprise business applications, and are superb in terms of cost and speed.” We’ve seen this argument before from French open-weight AI startup Mistral: It argues its small models actually perform better than larger models on several benchmarks after fine-tuning.  “The efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and adaptability of SLMs make them ideal for tailored applications where precision is paramount,” said Jon Knisley, an AI strategist at ABBYY, an Austin-based enterprise AI company.  While Markus thinks SLMs will be key in the agentic era, Knisley says the nature of small models means they’re better for deployment on local devices, “a trend accelerated by advancements in edge computing.” Humans don’t just learn through language; we learn by experiencing how the world works. But LLMs don’t really understand the world; they just predict the next word or idea. That’s why many researchers believe the next big leap will come from world models: AI systems that learn how things move and interact in 3D spaces so they can make predictions and take actions.  Signs that 2026 will be a big year for world models are multiplying. LeCun left Meta to start his own world model lab and is reportedly seeking a $5 billion valuation. Google’s DeepMind has been plugging away at Genie and in August launched its latest model that builds real-time interactive general-purpose world models. Alongside demos by startups like Decart and Odyssey, Fei-Fei Li’s World Labs has launched its first commercial world model, Marble. Newcomers like General Intuition in October scored a $134 million seed round to teach agents spatial reasoning, and video generation startup Runway in December released its first world model, GWM-1.  While researchers see long-term potential in robotics and autonomy, the near-term impact is likely to be seen first in video games. PitchBook predicts the market for world models in gaming could grow from $1.2 billion between 2022 and 2025 to $276 billion by 2030, driven by the tech’s ability to generate interactive worlds and more lifelike non-player characters.  Pim de Witte, founder of General Intuition, told TechCrunch virtual environments may not only reshape gaming, but also become critical testing grounds for the next generation of foundation models. Agents failed to live up to the hype in 2025, but a big reason for that is because it’s hard to connect them to the systems where work actually happens. Without a way to access tools and context, most agents were trapped in pilot workflows.  Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP), a “USB-C for AI” that lets AI agents talk to the external tools like databases, search engines, and APIs, proved the missing connective tissue and is quickly becoming the standard. OpenAI and Microsoft have publicly embraced MCP, and Anthropic recently donated it to the Linux Foundation’s new Agentic AI Foundation, which aims to help standardize open source agentic tools. Google also has begun standing up its own managed MCP servers to connect AI agents to its products and services.  With MCP reducing the friction of connecting agents to real systems, 2026 is likely to be the year agentic workflows finally move from demos into day-to-day practice.  Rajeev Dham, a partner at Sapphire Ventures, says these advancements will lead to agent-first solutions taking on “system-of-record roles” across industries.  “As voice agents handle more end-to-end tasks such as intake and customer communication, they’ll also begin to form the underlying core systems,” Dham said. “We’ll see this in a variety of sectors like home services, proptech, and healthcare, as well as horizontal functions such as sales, IT, and support.”  While more agentic workflows might raise worries that layoffs may follow, Katanforoosh of Workera isn’t so sure that’s the message: “2026 will be the year of the humans,” he said.  In 2024, every AI company predicted they would automate jobs out of needing humans. But the tech isn’t there yet, and in an unstable economy, that’s not really a popular rhetoric. Katanforoosh says next year, we’ll realize that “AI has not worked as autonomously as we thought,” and the conversation will focus more on how AI is being used to augment human workflows, rather than replace them.  “And I think a lot of companies are going to start hiring,” he added, noting that he expects there to be new roles in AI governance, transparency, safety, and data management. “I’m pretty bullish on unemployment averaging under 4% next year.” “People want to be above the API, not below it, and I think 2026 is an important year for this,” de Witte added. Advancements in technologies like small models, world models, and edge computing will enable more physical applications of machine learning, experts say.  “Physical AI will hit the mainstream in 2026 as new categories of AI-powered devices, including robotics, AVs, drones, and wearables start to enter the market,” Vikram Taneja, head of AT&T Ventures, told TechCrunch.  While autonomous vehicles and robotics are obvious use cases for physical AI that will no doubt continue to grow in 2026, the training and deployment required is still expensive. Wearables, on the other hand, provide a less expensive wedge with consumer buy-in. Smart glasses like the Ray-Ban Meta are starting to ship assistants that can answer questions about what you’re looking at, and new form factors like AI-powered health rings and smartwatches are normalizing always-on, on-body inference. “Connectivity providers will work to optimize their network infrastructure to support this new wave of devices, and those with flexibility in how they can offer connectivity will be best positioned,” Taneja said.

"European banks plan to cut 200,000 jobs as AI takes hold",https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/01/european-banks-plan-to-cut-200000-jobs-as-ai-takes-hold/,"Europe’s banking sector is about to get a tough lesson about efficiency. According to a new Morgan Stanley analysis reported by the Financial Times, more than 200,000 European banking jobs could vanish by 2030 as lenders lean into AI and shutter physical branches. That’s roughly 10% of the workforce at 35 major banks. The bloodletting will hit hardest in back-office operations, risk management, and compliance, the unglamorous guts of banking where algorithms are believed capable of tearing through spreadsheets faster and more effectively than humans. Banks are salivating over projected efficiency gains of 30%, according to the Morgan Stanley report. The downsizing isn’t confined to Europe. Goldman Sachs had warned U.S. employees in October of job cuts and a hiring freeze through the end of 2025 as part of an AI push dubbed “OneGS 3.0” that’s targeting everything from client onboarding to regulatory reporting. Some institutions are already swinging the axe. Dutch lender ABN Amro plans to cut a fifth of its staff by 2028, while Société Générale’s CEO has declared “nothing is sacred.” Still, some European banking leaders are urging caution, with a JPMorgan Chase exec telling the FT that if junior bankers never learn the fundamentals, it could come back to haunt the industry."
OpenAI bets big on audio as Silicon Valley declares war on screens,https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/01/openai-bets-big-on-audio-as-silicon-valley-declares-war-on-screens/,"OpenAI is betting big on audio AI, and it’s not just about making ChatGPT sound better. According to new reporting from The Information, the company has unified several engineering, product, and research teams over the past two months to overhaul its audio models, all in preparation for an audio-first personal device expected to launch in about a year. The move reflects where the entire tech industry is headed — toward a future where screens become background noise and audio takes center stage. Smart speakers have already made voice assistants a fixture in more than a third of U.S. homes. Meta just rolled out a feature for its Ray-Ban smart glasses that uses a five-microphone array to help you hear conversations in noisy rooms — essentially turning your face into a directional listening device. Google, meanwhile, began experimenting in June with “Audio Overviews” that transform search results into conversational summaries, and Tesla is integrating xAI’s chatbot Grok into its vehicles to create a conversational voice assistant that handles everything from navigation to climate control through natural dialogue. It’s not just the tech giants placing this bet. A motley crew of startups has emerged with the same conviction, albeit with varying degrees of success. The makers of the Humane AI Pin burned through hundreds of millions before their screenless wearable became a cautionary tale. The Friend AI pendant, a necklace that claims it will record your life and offer companionship, has sparked privacy concerns and existential dread in equal measure. And now at least two companies, including Sandbar and one helmed by Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky, are building AI rings expected to debut in 2026, allowing wearers to literally talk to the hand. The form factors may differ, but the thesis is the same: audio is the interface of the future. Every space — your home, your car, even your face — is becoming a control surface. OpenAI’s new audio model, slated for early 2026, will reportedly sound more natural, handle interruptions like an actual conversation partner, and even speak while you’re talking, which is something today’s models can’t manage. The company is also said to envision a family of devices, possibly including glasses or screenless smart speakers, that act less like tools and more like companions. None of this is hugely surprising. As The Information notes, former Apple design chief Jony Ive, who joined OpenAI’s hardware efforts through the company’s $6.5 billion acquisition in May of his firm io, has made reducing device addiction a priority, seeing audio-first design as a chance to “right the wrongs” of past consumer gadgets."
‘College dropout’ has become the most coveted startup founder credential,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/31/college-dropout-has-become-the-most-coveted-startup-founder-credential/,"Although iconic founders like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg famously didn’t finish college, multiple studies show that the vast majority of successful startups had founders with bachelor’s or graduate degrees. Despite this data, the appeal of a dropout founder persists, though VC enthusiasm for the ‘un-degreed’ is far from constant. It is a phenomenon that cycles in and out of fashion, and right now it is certainly having a moment amid the AI boom. This trend is particularly evident during Y Combinator Demo Days, where founders are increasingly touting their dropout status in their one-minute pitches. “I don’t believe YC formally tracks dropout status but, anecdotally, in recent batches, I was struck by how many founders highlight being a dropout from college, grad school, and even high school,” said Katie Jacobs Stanton, founder and general partner of Moxxie Ventures. “Being a dropout is a kind of credential in itself, reflecting a deep conviction and commitment to building. I think it’s perceived as something quite positive in the venture ecosystem.” Although many of the leading founders of the AI wave are young, most still opted to stay for the diploma. For instance, Michael Truell, the CEO of Cursor, graduated from MIT, and Cognition co-founder Scott Wu graduated from Harvard. Yet despite these examples, a growing number of aspiring entrepreneurs fear that staying to graduate means missing the most critical window of the AI building cycle. Some, like Brendan Foody, who co-founded Mercor, have famously dropped out of prestigious schools like Georgetown to pursue their startups. As Kulveer Taggar, founder of the YC-focused venture firm Phosphor Capital, told TechCrunch: “There’s just this sense of urgency and maybe FOMO.” There is a calculation right now: “I can finish my degree, or I can just start building.” This fear is leading to extreme cases. One professor at an elite university recently described a student walking away from his degree in his final semester. That student was convinced that having a diploma would actually hurt his chances of getting funded. While some founders fear that a diploma could be a negative signal, Yuri Sagalov, who leads General Catalyst’s seed strategy, suggests that VCs are less fixated on the dropout label, especially for students close to graduating: “I don’t think I’ve ever felt any different about someone who graduated or didn’t graduate when they’re in [their] fourth year and drop out.” Even though self-taught tech prodigies can build startups without a formal education, Sagalov argues that there’s still value in the social network that a university creates and the brand of the university, even if the founder doesn’t receive a diploma. ‘You get a lot of the social value… because you can put the fact that you participated,’ Sagalov said. “Most people will look you up on LinkedIn and not care as much whether you finished or not.” While many investors now believe founders can forego a university degree, not all VCs agree that young founders have an edge in this market. Wesley Chan, co-founder of FPV Ventures, isn’t as eager to invest in dropouts because he prioritizes a trait most young founders haven’t developed yet: wisdom. Chan believes that wisdom is typically found in “older founders or people who have a couple of scars under their belt.” "
Investors predict AI is coming for labor in 2026 ,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/31/investors-predict-ai-is-coming-for-labor-in-2026/,"Concerns about how AI will affect workers continue to rise in lockstep with the pace of advancements and new products promising automation and efficiency. Evidence suggests that fear is warranted. A November MIT study found an estimated 11.7% of jobs could already be automated using AI. Surveys have shown employers are already eliminating entry-level jobs because of the technology. Companies are also already pointing to AI as the reason for layoffs. As enterprises more meaningfully adopt AI, some may take a closer look at how many employees they really need. In a recent TechCrunch survey, multiple enterprise VCs said AI will have a big impact on the enterprise workforce in 2026. This was particularly interesting because the survey didn’t specifically ask about it. Eric Bahn, a co-founder and general partner at Hustle Fund, expects to see affects on labor in 2026. He’s just not sure exactly what that will look like. “I want to see what roles that have been known for more repetition get automated, or even more complicated roles with more logic become more automated,” Bahn said. “Is it going to lead to more layoffs? Is there going to be higher productivity? Or will AI just be an augmentation for the existing labor market to be even more productive in the future? All of this seems pretty unanswered, but it seems like something big is going to happen in 2026.” Marell Evans, founder and managing partner at Exceptional Capital, predicted companies looking to increase AI spending, will pull money from their pool for labor and hiring. “I think on the flip side of seeing an incremental increase in AI budgets, we’ll see more human labor get cut and layoffs will continue to aggressively impact the U.S. employment rate,” Evans said. Rajeev Dham, managing director at Sapphire, agreed that 2026 budgets will start to shift resources from labor to AI. Jason Mendel, a venture investor at Battery Ventures, added that AI will start to surpass just being a tool to make existing workers more efficient in 2026. “2026 will be the year of agents as software expands from making humans more productive to automating work itself, delivering on the human-labor displacement value proposition in some areas,” Mendel said. Antonia Dean, a partner at Black Operator Ventures, said even if companies aren’t shifting labor budgets toward AI projects, they will likely still say AI is the reason for layoffs or a reduction in labor costs anyway. “The complexity here is that many enterprises, despite how ready or not they are to successfully use AI solutions, will say that they are increasing their investments in AI to explain why they are cutting back spending in other areas or trimming workforces,” Dean said. “In reality, AI will become the scapegoat for executives looking to cover for past mistakes.” Many AI companies argue their technology doesn’t eliminate jobs but rather helps shift workers to “deep work” or to higher-skilled jobs while AI just automates repetitive “busy work.” But not everyone buys that argument, and people are worried that their jobs will be automated. According to VCs who invest in that area, it doesn’t sound like those fears will be quelled in 2026."
The phone is dead. Long live . . . what exactly?,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/30/the-phone-is-dead-long-live-what-exactly/,"True Ventures co-founder Jon Callaghan doesn’t think we’ll be using smartphones the way we do now in five years — and maybe not at all in 10. For a venture capitalist whose firm has had some big winners over its two decades – from consumer brands like Fitbit, Ring, and Peloton, to enterprise software makers HashiCorp and Duo Security – that’s more than armchair theorizing; it’s a thesis on which True Ventures is actively betting. True hasn’t gotten this far by following the crowd. The Bay Area firm has largely operated under the radar despite amassing roughly $4 billion in assets under management across 12 funds, including eight core fund and four “select,” opportunity-style funds that it has used to further back portfolio companies that are gaining momentum. While other VCs have grown more promotional – building personal brands on social media and podcasts to attract founders and deal flow – True has gone in the opposite direction, quietly cultivating a tight network of repeat founders. The strategy seems to be working: according to Callaghan, the firm boasts 63 exits with gains and seven IPOs amid a portfolio of some 300 companies assembled over its 20-year history. Three of True’s four recent exits in the fourth quarter of 2025 involved repeat founders who came back to work with the firm again after previous successes, says Callaghan. Still, it’s Callaghan’s thinking about the future of human-computer interaction that really stands out in a sea of AI hype and mega-rounds. “We’re not going to be using iPhones in 10 years,” Callaghan says flatly. “I kind of don’t think we’ll be using them in five years – or let’s say something different that’s a little safer – we’re going to be using them in very different ways.” His argument is simple: our phones are lousy at being the interface between humans and intelligence. “The way we take them out right now to send a text to confirm this or send you some message or write an email – [that’s] super inefficient, [and] not a great interface,” he explains. “[They’re] prone to error, prone to disruption [of] our normal lives.” So sure is he of this that True has been spending years exploring alternative interfaces – software-based, hardware-based, everything in between. It’s the same instinct that led True to bet early on Fitbit before wearables were obvious, to invest in Peloton after hundreds of other VCs said ‘no thanks,’ and to back Ring when founder Jamie Siminoff kept running out of money and even the judges on “Shark Tank” turned him away. Each time, the bet looked questionable, says Callaghan. Each time, the bet was on a new way for humans to interact with technology that felt more natural than what came before. The latest manifestation of this thesis is Sandbar, a hardware device that Callaghan describes as a “thought companion” — or, in more mundane terms, a voice-activated ring worn on the index finger. Its singular purpose: capturing and organizing your thoughts through voice notes. It’s not trying to be another Humane AI Pin or compete with Oura’s health tracking. “It does one thing really well,” Callaghan says. “But that one thing is a fundamental human behavioral need that is missing from technology today.” The idea isn’t to passively record ambient audio but to be there when an idea strikes, or a juicy bit of gossip or fresh information makes its way to the wearer that they want to remember. It’s attached to an app, leverages AI, and, according to Callaghan, represents a very different philosophy about how we should interact with intelligence. What drew True to Sandbar founders Mina Fahmi and Kirak Hong wasn’t just the product, though. “When we met Mina, we were just absolutely aligned on vision,” Callaghan recalls. True’s team had met with numerous teams at work on alternative interfaces. But the approach of Fahmi and Hong – who previously worked together on neural interfaces at CTRL-Labs, a startup acquired by Meta in 2019 – stood out. “It’s about what [the ring] enables. It’s about the behavior it enables that we will very soon realize we can’t live without.” There’s an echo here of Callaghan’s old line about Peloton: “It’s not about the bike.” To some, the bike – even its earliest iteration – was compelling. But Peloton was really about the behavior it enabled and the community it created; the bike was just the vessel. This philosophy of betting on new behaviors — not just new gadgets — also explains how True has managed to stay disciplined about capital. Even as AI startups raise hundreds of millions at billion-dollar valuations out of the gate, True insists that it’s able to stick to what it does best, which is to write seed checks of $3 million to $6 million for 15% to 20% ownership in startups that it often gets to see first. Callaghan says True will raise more money to fund what’s working, but he’s not interested in raising billions of dollars. “Like, why? You don’t need that to build something amazing today.” That same measured approach colors his view of the broader AI boom. While he says (when asked) that he believes OpenAI could soon be worth a trillion dollars, and while he calls this the most powerful compute wave we’ve seen, Callaghan sees warning signs in the circular financing deals backing hyperscalers and their $5 trillion in projected CapEx spending on data centers and chips. “We’re in a very capital intense part of the cycle, and that is worrisome,” he notes. That said, he’s optimistic about where the real opportunities lie. Callaghan thinks the greatest value creation is ahead of us – not in the infrastructure layer but in the application layer, where new interfaces will enable entirely new behaviors. It all comes back to his core investing philosophy, which sounds almost romantic — the kind of pitch-perfect VC wisdom that would ring hollow from most people: “It should be scary and lonely and you should be called crazy,” Callaghan says about early-stage investing done right. “And it should be really blurry and ambiguous, but you should be with a team that you really believe in.” Five to ten years later, he says, you’ll know if you were on to something. Either way, based on True’s track record of betting on hardware that many others missed – fitness trackers, connected bikes, smart doorbells, and now thought-capturing rings – it’s worth paying attention when Callaghan says the phone’s days are numbered. Being early is the whole point — and the trend lines support his thesis: the smartphone market is effectively saturated, growing at barely 2% annually, while wearables — smartwatches, rings, and voice-enabled devices — are expanding at double-digit rates. Something’s shifting in how we want to interact with technology, and True is placing its bets accordingly. This story originally misstated True’s assets under management (apologies).

The best AI-powered dictation apps of 2025,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/30/the-best-ai-powered-dictation-apps-of-2025/,"In some ways, 2025 was when AI dictation apps really took off. Dictation apps have been around for years, but in the past they’ve proved slow and inaccurate — unless you speak with particular accents and enunciate clearly. But advances in large language models (LLMs) and speech-to-text models have helped improve the systems that can decipher speech better while retaining the context to format the text. And developers have built in features to automatically format text, remove filler words, and ignore fumbles to output text that would need fewer edits. But with the soaring popularity of everything AI, there’s dozens of such apps on the market. So we’ve collated our pick of the best and most useful dictation apps his year. Wispr Flow is a well-funded AI dictation app that lets you add custom words and instructions for dictation. It has native apps for macOS, Windows, and iOS, and an Android version is in the works. The app lets you customize how its system transcribes your notes by letting you choose from “formal,” “casual,” and “very casual” styles for different kinds of writing, such as personal messaging, work, and email. And if you use it with vibe-coding tools like Cursor, you can turn on a feature to automatically recognize variables or tag files in the chat. The app lets you note up to 2,000 words per month for free on any of the desktop versions, and 1,000 words per month on iOS. Its subscription plans offer unlimited transcription and start at $15 per month. Willow advertises itself as a big time-saver for those who don’t like to type. Alongside common features like automatic editing and formatting, the app has a feature that taps large language models to generate a full chunk of text from just a few dictated words. Willow also takes a more privacy-focused stab at AI-assisted note-taking by storing all transcripts locally on your device, and lets you opt out of model training as well. It also lets you add custom vocabulary to the app to help it adapt to your industry’s parlance, or your local dialect. Willow lets you dictate 2,000 words per month on its desktop app for free. Individual subscription plans start at $15 per month, giving you unlimited dictation and enabling the app to remember your writing style. If you are focused on privacy, Monologue lets you download its model so you can run it on your device for transcriptions and avoid sending data to the cloud. What’s more, the app lets you customize its tone of voice according to the apps you use it with. Monologue lets you jot down 1,000 words per month for free, and its subscription costs $10 per month, or $100 per year. And if you end up becoming one of the app’s top users, the company will also send you this funky Monokey to use with the app. Keyboards are so 1983.You only need one key—Monokey, the limited edition device that turns your voice into text in Monologue.We're giving away 10, along with a free annual subscription to Monologue. pic.twitter.com/nXuz1ll2LU Superwhisper is primarily a dictation app, but it can also transcribe from audio or video files. The app gives you the freedom to choose and download AI models, including its own models that have different speeds and accuracy, along with Nvidia’s Parakeet speech-recognition models. The app also lets you write custom prompts to steer the output. You can easily see both processed and unprocessed transcripts that are integrated with the system keyboard. The basic voice-to-text feature is free to use, and you get 15 minutes to test out Pro features such as translation and transcription. The paid tier lets you use your own AI API keys and plug in cloud and local models without any caps. The monthly plan costs $8.49 per month, the annual plan costs $84.99 per month, or you can pay $249.99 for a lifetime subscription. The VoiceTypr app takes an offline-first, no-subscription approach, letting you use local models for transcription. There’s also a GitHub repository for those who want to host and run the open source version themselves. VoiceTypr supports over 99 languages and works on both Mac and Windows. The app is available to try for three days for free, and after that it will allow you to buy a lifetime license. The app costs $35 for one device, $56 for two, and $98 for four devices. Aqua is another Y Combinator-backed voice-typing client for Windows and macOS that claims to be one of the fastest tools in the category in terms of latency. Besides handling grammar and punctuation, Aqua also lets you autofill text by saying phrases — you can say “my address” and have Aqua type in your address, for example. The app also offers its own speech-to-text API for other apps. The free tier gets you 1,000 words per month. The paid plans start from $8 per month (annual billing) and unlock unlimited words and 800 custom dictionary values. Handy is an open source and free transcription tool that can run on Mac, Windows, and Linux. The application is pretty basic and doesn’t offer a lot of customization, but if you are trying to get started with using your voice more and don’t want to pay, it is a good option. The app has a basic settings menu that lets you toggle push-to-talk, and change the hotkey to activate the transcription. Typeless is another app in this category with a high free word count. The company claims that it doesn’t retain any data or use it to train models. Typeless also suggests a better version of the sentence if you might have fumbled a line. The app lets you dictate up to 4,000 words per week (roughly 16,000 words per month) on its free tier. You can pay $12 per month (billed annually) to unlock unlimited words and get access to new features. Typeless is available for Windows and macOS only."
VCs predict enterprises will spend more on AI in 2026 — through fewer vendors,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/30/vcs-predict-enterprises-will-spend-more-on-ai-in-2026-through-fewer-vendors/,"Enterprises have been piloting and testing different AI tools for the past few years to figure out what their adoption strategy will look like. Investors think that period of experimentation is coming to an end. TechCrunch recently surveyed 24 enterprise-focused VCs and an overwhelming majority predicted enterprises will increase their budgets for AI in 2026 — but not for everything. Most investors said this budget increase will be concentrated and that many enterprises will spend more funds on fewer contracts. Andrew Ferguson, a vice president at Databricks Ventures, predicted 2026 will be the year that enterprises start consolidating their investments and picking winners. “Today, enterprises are testing multiple tools for a single-use case, and there’s an explosion of startups focused on certain buying centers like [go-to-market], where it’s extremely hard to discern differentiation even during [proof of concepts],” Ferguson said. “As enterprises see real proof points from AI, they’ll cut out some of the experimentation budget, rationalize overlapping tools and deploy that savings into the AI technologies that have delivered.” Rob Biederman, a managing partner at Asymmetric Capital Partners, agreed. He predicts that enterprise companies will not only concentrate their individual spending, but also the broader enterprise landscape will narrow its overall AI spending to only a handful of vendors across the entire industry. “Budgets will increase for a narrow set of AI products that clearly deliver results and will decline sharply for everything else,” Biederman said. “We expect a bifurcation where a small number of vendors capture a disproportionate share of enterprise AI budgets while many others see revenue flatten or contract.” Scott Beechuk, a partner at Norwest Venture Partners, thinks enterprises will increase their spending on the tools that make AI safe for enterprises to use. “Enterprises now recognize that the real investment lies in the safeguards and oversight layers that make AI dependable,” Beechuk said. “As these capabilities mature and reduce risk, organizations will feel confident shifting from pilots to scaled deployments, and budgets will increase.” Harsha Kapre, a director at Snowflake Ventures, predicted enterprises will spend on AI in three distinct areas in 2026: strengthening data foundations, model post-training optimization, and consolidation of tools. “[Chief investment officers] are actively reducing [software-as-a-service] sprawl and moving toward unified, intelligent systems that lower integration costs and deliver measurable [return on investment],” Kapre said. “AI-enabled solutions are likely going to see the biggest benefit from this shift.” A shift away from experimentation and toward concentration will affect startups. What’s not clear, is how. It’s possible that AI startups will reach the same reckoning point that SaaS startups arrived at a few years ago. The companies operating hard-to-replicate products such as vertical solutions or those built on proprietary data will likely still be able to grow. Startups with products similar to those offered by large enterprise suppliers, like AWS or Salesforce, may start to see pilot projects and funding dry up. Investors see this possibility too. When asked how they know that an AI startup has a moat, multiple VCs said companies with proprietary data and products that can’t easily be replicated by a tech giant or large language model company are the most defensible. If investor predictions are true and enterprises do start to concentrate their AI spend next year, 2026 could be the year enterprise budgets increase but many AI startups don’t see a bigger slice of the pie."
"Meta just bought Manus, an AI startup everyone has been talking about",https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/29/meta-just-bought-manus-an-ai-startup-everyone-has-been-talking-about/,"Mark Zuckerberg has struck again. Meta Platforms is acquiring Manus, a Singapore-based AI startup that’s become the talk of Silicon Valley since it debuted last spring with a demo video that showed an AI agent doing things like screening job candidates, planning vacations, and analyzing stock portfolios. Manus claimed at the time that it outperformed OpenAI’s Deep Research. In April, just weeks after launch, venture capital firm Benchmark led a $75 million funding round that assigned Manus a post-money valuation of $500 million and saw Benchmark general partner Chetan Puttagunta joining the startup’s board. Per Chinese media outlets, some other big-name backers had already invested in Manus at that point, including Tencent, ZhenFund, and HSG (formerly known as Sequoia China) via a $10 million round. The company announced in mid-December that it has since signed up millions of users and is generating annual recurring revenue of more than $100 million from monthly and yearly subscribers to its membership service. It was around this time that Meta started negotiating with Manus, according to the WSJ, which says the tech giant is paying $2 billion — the valuation Manus was reportedly seeking for its next funding round. For Zuckerberg, who has staked Meta’s future on AI, Manus represents something new: an AI product that’s actually making money. This is especially pertinent given that investors have grown increasingly twitchy about Meta’s $60 billion infrastructure spending spree, and the broader tech industry’s debt-backed expenditures on data center construction. Meta says it’ll keep Manus running independently and weave the startup’s AI agents into Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, where Meta’s own chatbot, Meta AI, is already available to users. There is one wrinkle, however: Manus’ Chinese founders founded its parent company, Butterfly Effect, in Beijing in 2022, before decamping to Singapore in the middle of this year. Whether that raises flags in Washington remains to be seen, but Senator John Cornyn has already dragged Benchmark for its investment in the company, raising concerns back in May about American capital going to a Chinese concern. Cornyn, a Texas Republican and senior member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has long been one of Congress’ most vocal hawks on China and technology competition, but he’s hardly alone. Being tough on China has become one of the few genuinely bipartisan issues in Congress. Unsurprisingly, Meta has already told Nikkei Asia that after the acquisition, Manus won’t have any ties to Chinese investors and will no longer operate in China. “There will be no continuing Chinese ownership interests in Manus AI following the transaction, and Manus AI will discontinue its services and operations in China,” a Meta spokesperson told the outlet."
2025 was the year AI got a vibe check,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/29/2025-was-the-year-ai-got-a-vibe-check/,"Money was no object for the AI industry in early 2025. A vibe check crept in the second half of the year.  OpenAI raised $40 billion at a $300 billion valuation. Safe Superintelligence and Thinking Machine Labs raised individual $2 billion seed rounds before shipping a single product. Even first-time founders were raising at a scale that once belonged only to Big Tech.  Such astronomical investments were followed by equally incredible spends. Meta shelled out nearly $15 billion to lock up Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang and spent countless more millions to poach talent from other AI labs. Meanwhile, AI’s biggest players promised close to $1.3 trillion in future infrastructure spending.  The first half of 2025 matched the fervor, and investor interest, of the prior year. That mood has shifted in recent months to deliver a vibe check of sorts. Extreme optimism for AI, and the accompanying wild valuations, is still intact. But that rosy view is now being tempered with concerns over an AI bubble bursting, user safety, and the sustainability of technological progress at its current pace.  The era of unabashed acceptance and celebration of AI is fading just a skosh at the edges. And with it, more scrutiny and questions. Can AI companies sustain their own velocity? Does scaling in the post-DeepSeek era require billions? Is there a business model that returns a sliver of the multi-billions of investment?  We’ve been there for every step. And our most popular stories of 2025 tell the real story: an industry hitting a reality check even as it promises to reshape reality itself.  The biggest AI labs got bigger this year.  In 2025 alone, OpenAI raised a SoftBank-led $40 billion round at a $300 billion post-money valuation. The company also reportedly has investors like Amazon orbiting with compute-tied circular deals and is in talks to raise $100 billion at an $830 billion valuation. That would bring OpenAI close to the $1 trillion valuation it is reportedly seeking in an IPO next year.  OpenAI rival Anthropic also closed $16.5 billion this year across two rounds; its most recent raise pushed its valuation to $183 billion with heavy hitters like Iconiq Capital, Fidelity, and the Qatar Investment Authority participating. (CEO Dario Amodei confessed to staff in a leaked memo that he was “not thrilled” about taking money from dictatorial Gulf states.)  Then there’s Elon Musk’s xAI, which raised at least $10 billion this year after acquiring X. We’ve also seen smaller, new startups get a hypey boost from froth-mouthed investors.  Former OpenAI chief technologist Mira Murati’s startup Thinking Machine Labs secured a $2 billion seed round at a $12 billion valuation despite sharing almost no information about its product offering. Vibe-coding startup Lovable’s $200 million Series A earned it a unicorn horn just eight months after launching; this month, Lovable raised another $330 million at a nearly $7 billion post-money valuation. And we can’t leave out AI recruiting startup Mercor, which raised $450 million this year across two rounds, the latest bringing its valuation up to $10 billion.  These absurdly large valuations are still happening even against the backdrop of still-modest enterprise adoption figures and serious infrastructure constraints, heightening fears of an AI bubble.  For the larger firms, those numbers aren’t coming from nowhere. Justifying those valuations requires building vast amounts of infrastructure.  The result has created a vicious cycle. Capital raised to fund compute is increasingly tied to deals where the same money flows back into chips, cloud contracts, and energy, as seen in OpenAI’s infrastructure-linked funding with Nvidia. In practice, it’s blurring the line between investment and customer demand, stoking fears that the AI boom is being propped up by circular economics rather than sustainable usage. Some of the biggest deals this year powering the infrastructure boom were:  But cracks are beginning to show. A private financing partner, Blue Owl Capital, recently pulled out of a planned $10 billion Oracle data-center deal tied to OpenAI capacity, underscoring how fragile some of these capital stacks can be.  Whether all that spending ultimately materializes is another question. Grid constraints, soaring construction and power costs, and growing pushback from residents and policymakers — including calls from figures like Sen. Bernie Sanders to rein in data center expansion — are already slowing projects in some regions.  Even as AI investment remains enormous, the infrastructure reality is beginning to temper the hype.  In 2023 and 2024, each major model release felt like a revelation, with new capabilities and fresh reasons to fall for the hype. This year, the magic faded, and nothing captured that shift better than OpenAI’s GPT-5 rollout.  While it was meaningful on paper, it didn’t land with the same punch as earlier releases like GPT-4 and 4o. Similar patterns emerged across the industry as improvements from LLM providers were less transformative and more incremental or domain-specific.  Even Gemini 3, which is topping several benchmarks, was only a breakthrough insofar as it brought Google back up to equal footing with OpenAI — which sparked Sam Altman’s infamous “code red” memo and OpenAI’s fight to maintain dominance. There was also a reset this year in terms of where we expect frontier models to come from. DeepSeek’s launch of R1, its “reasoning” model that competed with OpenAI’s o1 on key benchmarks, proved that new labs can ship credible models fast and at a fraction of the cost.  As the size of each leap between new models shrinks, investors are focused less on raw model capacity and more on what’s wrapped around it. The question is: Who can turn AI into a product that people rely on, pay for, and integrate into their daily workflows?  That shift is manifesting in several ways as companies see what works, and what customers will let fly. AI search startup Perplexity, for example, briefly floated the idea of tracking users’ online movements to sell them hyper-personalized ads. Meanwhile, OpenAI was reportedly considering charging up to $20,000 per month for specialized AI, a sign of how aggressively companies tested the waters of what customers might be willing to pay. More than anything, though, the fight has moved to distribution. Perplexity is trying to stay relevant by launching its own Comet browser with agentic capabilities and paying Snap $400 million to power search inside Snapchat, effectively buying its way into existing user funnels.  OpenAI is pursuing a parallel strategy, expanding ChatGPT beyond a chatbot and into a platform. OpenAI has launched its own Atlas browser and other consumer-facing features like Pulse, while also courting enterprises and developers by launching apps inside ChatGPT itself.  Google, for its part, is leaning on incumbency. On the consumer side, Gemini is being integrated directly into products like Google Calendar, while on the enterprise side, the company is hosting MCP connectors to make its ecosystem harder to dislodge.  In a market where it’s getting tougher to differentiate by dropping a new model, owning the customer and the business model is the real moat.  AI companies received unprecedented scrutiny in 2025. More than 50 copyright lawsuits wound through the courts, while reports of “AI psychosis” — the result of chatbots reinforcing delusions and allegedly contributing to multiple suicides and other life-threatening episodes — sparked calls for trust and safety reforms.  While some copyright battles met their end — like Anthropic’s $1.5 billion settlement to authors — most are still unresolved. Though, the conversation appears to be shifting from resistance against using copyrighted content for training to demands for compensation. (See: New York Times is suing Perplexity for copyright infringement.) Meanwhile, mental health concerns around AI chatbot interactions — and their sycophantic responses — emerged as a serious public health issue following multiple deaths by suicide and life-threatening delusions in teens and adults after prolonged chatbot usage. The result has been lawsuits, widespread concern among mental health professionals, and swift policy responses like California’s SB 243 regulating AI companion bots. Perhaps most telling: The calls for restraints are not coming from the usual anti-tech suspects.  Industry leaders have warned against chatbots “juicing engagement,” and even Sam Altman has cautioned against emotional overreliance on ChatGPT.  Even the labs themselves started sounding alarms. Anthropic’s May safety report documented Claude Opus 4 attempting to blackmail engineers to prevent its own shutdown. The subtext? Scaling without understanding what you’ve built is no longer a viable strategy. If 2025 was the year AI started to grow up and face hard questions, 2026 will be the year it has to answer them. The hype cycle is starting to fizzle out, and now AI companies will be forced to prove their business models and demonstrate real economic value. The era of “trust us, the returns will come” is nearing its end. What comes next will either be a vindication or a reckoning that makes the dot-com bust look like a bad day of trading for Nvidia. Time to place your bets. "
Plaud Note Pro is an excellent AI-powered recorder that I carry everywhere,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/29/plaud-note-pro-is-an-excellent-ai-powered-recorder-that-i-carry-everywhere/,"There has been a flurry of AI voice recording gadgets like Omi, Bee, and Friend that want to capture your voice and let you converse with an AI chatbot. While Bee was acquired by Amazon, and devices like the Stream ring by Sandbar and a new AI ring from former Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky are set to enter the market next year, the jury is still out on the success of wearable AI devices. Amid all this, Plaud is thriving by targeting professional users with a different approach: a credit card-sized recording device that slips into your wallet. The company says it has shipped more than a million units and that more than 50% of its customers have converted to pro subscriptions. The company’s latest iteration, the Plaud Note Pro, launched for preorder in August, two years after the original Note, priced at $179. After using the device for over a month, it has become an essential part of my daily carry — and its ultra-thin design makes that easy. At just 0.12 inches thick — about the width of three stacked credit cards — it’s the thinnest AI recording device on the market and easily fits in a wallet or attaches magnetically to the back of your phone. The company provides a wallet-like pouch and a magnetic ring accessory that attaches to MagSafe-enabled phones, allowing you to mount the Note Pro on the back of your iPhone or compatible Android device. The device is also very light at 30 grams, and you won’t feel the weight if you keep the Note Pro in your wallet. One of the key differences between Plaud and other AI wearables is that the Note Pro doesn’t need to be connected to your phone to record audio. The device has 64GB of onboard memory, so it can store a large volume of recordings without transferring them to your phone or uploading them to the cloud. Plaud Note Pro has four MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) microphones to pick up audio from all directions. While the company advertises that the effective audio range is 16.4 feet, I have recorded talks at conferences while sitting far from the stage and gotten satisfactory results. The device also has one voice processing unit for noise suppression, voice isolation, and echo cancellation. The recording device has impressive battery life. I went to a conference earlier this month with a fully charged device and recorded a few interviews and talks there. After that, I used the device for some phone call recording and personal note-taking. Despite all that use, the device still had 55% charge after 15 days. The company says you can wring 30 hours of continuous recording and 60 days of standby from a single charge. Plaud’s new device comes with a proprietary charger with a USB-C cable on the other end. The device takes two hours to charge from 0%, and then you are set for at least a couple of weeks unless you are recording hours of content. One problem with wearable AI devices is that you have to ensure, through an indicator, that the device is recording (or has stopped recording). Thankfully, Plaud Note Pro has a tiny screen that displays your recording status. You can also press a button while recording to highlight a point a speaker is making, and it will show up in the AI-powered summary prominently. The screen also shows you the remaining battery level. There is intentionality behind recording with this device. You also get haptic feedback for starting and stopping the recording. The visual indication and your action of pressing the button also make it easier to signal to others in the meeting that you are recording the session. You can choose to just record sessions and export them to another AI transcription service you are subscribed to. Plaud natively provides 300 minutes of free transcription every month. The company also lets you customize AI-generated notes through templates suited for different profiles and tasks. You can create your own template as well. The transcription is accurate in most instances, and now you can also access the recording, transcript, and notes through a website. The company has also addressed the problem my former colleague Brian Heater had of tapping on the word and not being played the corresponding recording. While a pendant or pin-like form factor is possibly easier to carry, the card-sized recorder offers better microphones and more versatile placement options. It’s worth buying the $179 gadget if you take a lot of in-person meetings.   "
"How to use the new ChatGPT app integrations, including DoorDash, Spotify, Uber, and others",https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/29/how-to-use-the-new-chatgpt-app-integrations-including-doordash-spotify-uber-and-others/,"OpenAI offers app integrations in ChatGPT to allow you to connect your accounts directly to ChatGPT and ask the assistant to do things for you. For instance, with a Spotify integration, you can tell it to create personalized playlists that will show up right in your Spotify app. To get started, make sure you’re logged into ChatGPT. Then type the name of the app you want to use at the start of your prompt, and ChatGPT will guide you through signing in and connecting your account. If you want to set everything up at once, head over to the Settings menu, then click on Apps and Connectors. You can browse through the available apps, pick the ones you like, and it’ll take you to the sign-in page for each one.  However, it’s important to note that connecting your account means you’re sharing your app data with ChatGPT. Make sure to review the permissions you’re giving when you’re linking your accounts. For example, if you connect your Spotify account, ChatGPT can see your playlists, listening history, and other personal information. (Sharing this info helps personalize the experience, but if you have privacy concerns, consider whether you’re comfortable with this level of access before connecting.) You can also disconnect any app whenever you want, right from the Settings menu. This integration with the online travel giant is designed to help travelers, especially first-time visitors in need of suggestions for where to stay. Once you link your Booking.com account, you can ask ChatGPT to find hotels in your preferred city based on your dates and budget. You can also specify how many people are coming and whether you want the hotel near public transport. ChatGPT aims to make this process more intuitive than searching directly on the Booking.com site. Plus, you can be more specific, like searching for options “with breakfast included.”  When you find a hotel you like, just open the Booking.com listing to complete your reservation. Canva in ChatGPT is a helpful tool for graphic designers and anyone else who needs to generate visual content quickly. Whether it’s for a social media post, a poster, or a slide deck for a presentation, this may be a good way to help kickstart your project and brainstorm ideas.  Once you connect your Canva account, you can ask ChatGPT to design something like “a 16:9 slide deck about our Q4 roadmap” or “a fun poster for a dog-walking business.” You can include specifics such as the fonts you prefer, color schemes, formats (like Instagram posts or stories), and exact dimensions.  AI-generated designs are seldom perfect, with occasional distorted images or spelling mistakes. However, some users may find this better than starting from scratch, and they can jump into Canva at any time to tweak their design and make it look just how they want. Coursera’s integration is designed to help you quickly discover the best online courses for your skill level. For instance, you can then tell ChatGPT to find an “intermediate-level course on Python.” You can then tell the chatbot to compare course options by rating, duration, and cost before enrolling. ChatGPT can also provide a quick rundown of what exactly each course covers. DoorDash’s newly launched ChatGPT integration aims to save time on meal planning and grocery shopping. Users can ask the chatbot for a meal plan and instantly add all ingredients to their DoorDash cart, then review and check out. ​Currently, this feature is available only to users in the U.S., with participating grocery retailers, including Kroger, Safeway, Fairway Market, Wegmans, and more. ChatGPT can display hotel options and flights via Expedia without leaving chat. Whether you’re looking for a quick escape or a longer trip, it can find flights that fit your travel dates, budget, and number of travelers. You can narrow things down by saying stuff like “Only show 4-star hotels.” Once you see something you like, go to Expedia to finalize everything and book your trip. To use Figma in ChatGPT, you can ask it to generate diagrams, flow charts, and more. This is helpful for turning your ideas and brainstorming sessions into something more tangible. It may also be useful for visualizing complex concepts or workflows. You can also upload files and ask the chatbot to generate a product roadmap for your team. This roadmap can include milestones, deliverables, and deadlines, helping your team stay organized and focused on their goals. One of the most helpful aspects of using Spotify in ChatGPT is the ability to quickly create playlists and listen to new recommended songs tailored to your specific tastes. You can ask it to create a playlist based on your current mood, or just a playlist that only includes tracks by your favorite band.  It can also suggest new artists, playlists, audiobooks, and podcast episodes. Additionally, ChatGPT can perform actions on your behalf, including adding and removing items from your Spotify library.  Retail giant Target strategically launched a beta version of its ChatGPT integration before Black Friday. This feature allows shoppers to ask the chatbot for gift suggestions and quickly create a shopping basket with multiple items without leaving ChatGPT. For example, users can request ideas for a movie night, and the chatbot will provide a curated selection of available Target items. Shoppers can add these items to their cart and make a purchase using their Target account. They can then choose from same-day “Drive Up,” in-store pickup, or standard shipping. If you’re planning a trip, the Uber integration makes it easy to find ride options, which is especially useful if you’re in a new country. You can set up your trip in the ChatGPT app, then complete the ride request and payment in the Uber app. Currently, it’s only available in the U.S., and it doesn’t let you book rides in advance; only on-demand rides are available. You can choose from options like UberX, UberXL, Comfort, and Black. There’s also an Uber Eats integration for U.S. users, so you can check out local restaurants and menu items within ChatGPT, then finish paying in the Uber Eats app. If you’re looking for a new home, Zillow in ChatGPT could make the search experience more straightforward. Using a simple text prompt, you can find homes that meet your criteria and apply filters to narrow the results. Whether you’re looking for a specific price range, number of bedrooms, or particular neighborhoods, you can specify these details in your prompt, making the search process much more efficient and tailored to your needs.  Alongside the announcement that OpenAI would bring apps into ChatGPT, the company also said it plans to welcome additional partners soon, including OpenTable, PayPal, and Walmart. These will launch in 2026.  The rollout of ChatGPT’s app integrations is currently limited to the U.S. and Canada. Users in Europe and the U.K. are excluded for now. This story has been updated to include newly launched integrations.  "
VCs predict strong enterprise AI adoption next year — again,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/29/vcs-predict-strong-enterprise-ai-adoption-next-year-again/,"It’s been three years since OpenAI released ChatGPT and kicked off a surge in innovation and attention on AI. Since then, optimists have regularly claimed that AI will become a critical part of the enterprise software industry, and so enterprise AI startups mushroomed on the back of immense amounts of investment.   But enterprises are still struggling to see the benefit of adopting these new AI tools. An MIT survey in August found that 95% of enterprises weren’t getting a meaningful return on their investments in AI. So when will businesses start seeing real benefits from using and integrating AI? TechCrunch surveyed 24 enterprise-focused VCs, and they overwhelmingly think 2026 will be the year when enterprises start to meaningfully adopt AI, see value from it, and increase their budgets for the tech.   Enterprise VCs have been saying that for three years now. Will 2026 actually be different?  Let’s hear what they have to say: Kirby Winfield, founding general partner, Ascend: Enterprises are realizing that LLMs are not a silver bullet for most problems. Just because Starbucks can use Claude to write their own CRM software doesn’t mean they should. We’ll focus on custom models, fine tuning, evals, observability, orchestration, and data sovereignty.   Molly Alter, partner, Northzone: A subset of enterprise AI companies will shift from product businesses to AI consulting. These companies may start with a specific product, such as AI customer support or AI coding agents. But once they have enough customer workflows running off their platform, they can replicate the forward-deployed engineer model with their own team to build additional use cases for customers. In other words, many specialized AI product companies will become generalist AI implementers.  Marcie Vu, partner, Greycroft: We’re very excited about the opportunity in voice AI. Voice is a far more natural, efficient, and expressive way for people to communicate with each other and with machines. We’ve spent decades typing on computers and staring at screens, but speech is how we engage in the real world. I am eager to see how builders reimagine products, experiences, and interfaces with voice as the primary mode of interaction with intelligence.  Alexa von Tobel, founder and managing partner, Inspired Capital: 2026 will be the year AI reshapes the physical world — especially in infrastructure, manufacturing, and climate monitoring. We are moving from a reactive world to a predictive one, where physical systems can sense problems before they become failures.   Lonne Jaffe, managing director, Insight Partners: We’re watching how frontier labs approach the application layer. A lot of people assumed labs would just train models and hand them off for others to build on, but that doesn’t seem to be how they are thinking about it. We may see frontier labs shipping more turnkey applications directly into production in domains like finance, law, healthcare, and education than people expect.  Tom Henriksson, general partner, OpenOcean: If I had to pick one word for quantum in 2026, it’s momentum. Trust in quantum advantage is building fast, with companies publishing roadmaps to demystify the tech. But don’t expect major software breakthroughs yet; we still need more hardware performance to cross that threshold. Emily Zhao, principal, Salesforce Ventures: We are targeting two distinct frontiers — AI entering the physical world and the next evolution of model research. Michael Stewart, managing partner, M12: Future datacenter technology. For the last year or so, we’ve been standing up a few new investments that signal our interest in future “token factory” technology, with an eye towards what can really advance how efficiently and cleanly they run. This is going to continue in 2026 and beyond, in categories that include everything within the walls of the data center: cooling, compute, memory, and networking within and between sites.  Jonathan Lehr, co-founder and general partner, Work-Bench: Vertical enterprise software where proprietary workflows and data create defensibility, particularly in regulated industries, supply chain, retail, and other complex operational environments. Aaron Jacobson, partner, NEA: We are at the limit of humanity’s ability to generate enough energy to feed power-hungry GPUs. As an investor, I’m looking for software and hardware that can drive breakthroughs in performance per watt. This could be better GPU management, more efficient AI chips, next-gen networking approaches like optical, or rethinking thermal load within AI systems and data centers.  Rob Biederman, managing partner, Asymmetric Capital Partners: A moat in AI is less about the model itself and more about economics and integration. We look for companies that are deeply embedded in enterprise workflows, have access to proprietary or continuously improving data, and demonstrate defensibility through switching costs, cost advantages, or outcomes that are difficult to replicate.   Jake Flomenberg, partner, Wing Venture Capital: I’m skeptical of moats built purely on model performance or prompting — those advantages erode in months. The question I ask: If OpenAI or Anthropic launches a model tomorrow and is 10x better, does this company still have a reason to exist?   Molly Alter, partner, Northzone: It’s much easier today to build a moat in a vertical category rather than a horizontal one. The best moats are data moats, where each incremental customer, data point, or interaction makes the product better. These are somewhat easier to build in specialized categories like manufacturing, construction, health, or legal, where data is more consistent across customers. But there are also interesting “workflow moats,” where defensibility comes from understanding how a task or project moves from point A to point B in an industry.   Harsha Kapre, director, Snowflake Ventures: For AI startups, the strongest moat comes from how effectively they transform an enterprise’s existing data into better decisions, workflows, and customer experiences. Enterprises already sit on incredibly rich data; what they lack is the ability to reason over it in a targeted, trustworthy way. We look for startups that blend technical expertise with deep industry knowledge and can bring domain-specific solutions directly to a customer’s governed data, without creating new silos, to deliver insights or automation that weren’t previously possible.    Kirby Winfield, founding general partner, Ascend: Enterprises are realizing that random experiments with dozens of solutions create chaos. They will focus on fewer solutions with more thoughtful engagement.   Antonia Dean, partner, Black Operator Ventures: The complexity here is that many enterprises, despite how ready or not they are to successfully use AI solutions, will say that they are increasing their investments in AI to explain why they are cutting back spending in other areas or trimming workforces. In reality, AI will become the scapegoat for executives looking to cover for past mistakes. Scott Beechuk, partner, Norwest Venture Partners: We’re definitely getting closer. If last year was about laying the infrastructure for AI, 2026 is when we begin to see whether the application layer can turn that investment into real value. As specialized models mature and oversight improves, AI systems are becoming more reliable in daily workflows.   Marell Evans, founder and managing partner, Exceptional Capital: Yes, but still incremental. There is still a lot of iteration, and AI is still improving to the point of being able to showcase pain-point solutions for enterprises across a variety of industries. I believe solving simulation to reality training will likely open up many opportunities for a selection of industries, both existing and nascent.  Jennifer Li, general partner, Andreessen Horowitz: There have been sensational headlines this year about enterprises not seeing returns on their AI investments. Ask any software engineer if they would ever want to go back to the dark ages before they had AI coding tools. Unlikely. My point is, enterprises are already gaining value this year, and it will multiply across organizations next year.  Rajeev Dham, managing director, Sapphire: Yes, I believe they will, though it’s nuanced. Rather than simply increasing AI budgets, organizations will shift portions of their labor spend toward AI technologies or generate such strong top-line ROI from AI capabilities that the investment effectively pays for itself three to five times over.  Rob Biederman, managing partner, Asymmetric Capital Partners: Budgets will increase for a narrow set of AI products that clearly deliver results and will decline sharply for everything else. Overall spend may grow, but it will be significantly more concentrated. We expect a bifurcation, where a small number of vendors capture a disproportionate share of enterprise AI budgets while many others see revenue flatten or contract.  Gordon Ritter, founder and general partner, Emergence Capital: Yes, but spend will concentrate. Enterprises will increase budgets where AI expands on institutional advantages, and pull back from tools that simply automate workflows without capturing (and securing!) proprietary intelligence.  Andrew Ferguson, vice president, Databricks Ventures: 2026 will be the year that CIOs push back on AI vendor sprawl. Today, enterprises are testing out multiple tools for a single use case — monthly spend and switching costs are low in many cases, so the incentive to experiment is there — and there’s an explosion of startups focused on certain buying centers like [go-to-market], where it’s extremely hard to discern differentiation even during [proof of concepts]. As enterprises see real proof points from AI, they’ll cut out some of the experimentation budget, rationalize overlapping tools, and deploy those savings into the AI technologies that have delivered.   Ryan Isono, managing director, Maverick Ventures: In aggregate, yes, and there will be some shifting from pilots/experimental budgets to budgeted line items. A boon for AI startups in 2026 will be the transition of enterprises who tried to build in-house solutions and have now realized the difficulty and complexity required in production at scale.   Jake Flomenberg, partner, Wing Venture Capital: The best companies right now combine two things: a compelling “why now” narrative — usually tied to GenAI creating new attack surfaces, infrastructure needs, or workflow opportunities — and concrete proof of enterprise adoption. One million dollars to $2 million [annual recurring revenue] is the baseline, but what matters more than that is whether customers view you and your product as mission-critical to their business versus just being a nice-to-have. Revenue without narrative is a feature; narrative without traction is vaporware. You need both.  Lonne Jaffe, managing director, Insight Partners: You should aim to show you’re building in a space where the [total addressable market] expands rather than evaporates as AI drives down costs. Some markets have high elasticity of demand — a 90% price decline leads to a 10x increase in market size. Others have low elasticity, where dropping the price can vaporize the market, so the customers keep all of the value being created.  Jonathan Lehr, co-founder and general partner, Work-Bench: Customers are using the product in real, day-to-day operations and are willing to take reference calls and talk honestly about impact, reliability, and buying process, etc. Companies should be able to clearly show how the product saves time, reduces cost, or increases output in a way that holds up through security, legal, and procurement reviews.  Michael Stewart, managing partner, M12: We (investors) were casting a doubtful eye towards [estimated annual recurring revenue] or pilot revenue until recently. Now it’s not seen as much of an asterisk as much as the customer’s interest and willingness to evaluate a solution in the face of so many options pushed their way. Getting those engagements and customer buy-in in terms of running an evaluation isn’t just a matter of forward-deployed engineers making it easier for the customer. It takes quality and a winning marketing message to do it in 2026. Investors are expecting to see conversions become the leading part of the story after six months of pilot use.  Marell Evans, founder and managing partner, Exceptional Capital: Execution and traction. The best signal is users genuinely delighted to use the product and the technical sophistication of the business. We look at a huge north star of real contractual agreements, 12+ months. In addition to that, was this founder able to attract top-tier talent to join their startup over competitors or the traditional hyper-scalers? Nnamdi Okike, managing partner and co-founder, 645 Ventures: Agents will still be in their initial adoption phase by the end of 2026. There are many technical and compliance hurdles that need to be overcome for enterprises to truly benefit from AI agents. There also need to be standards created for agent-to-agent communication.  Rajeev Dham, managing director, Sapphire: One universal agent will emerge. Today, each agent is siloed in its role — for example, inbound [sales development representative], outbound SDR, customer support, product discovery, etc. But by late next year, we’ll start to see these roles converge into a single agent with shared context and memory, breaking down long-standing organizational silos, and enabling a more unified, contextual conversation between companies and their users.  Antonia Dean, partner, Black Operator Ventures: The winners will be organizations that figure out the right balance of autonomy and oversight quickly and that recognize agent deployment as collaborative augmentation rather than a clean division of labor. Rather than agents handling all routine work while humans do all the thinking, we’ll see more sophisticated collaboration between humans and agents on complex tasks, with the boundary between their roles continuously evolving.  Aaron Jacobson, partner, NEA: The majority of knowledge workers will have at least one agentic co-worker they know by name!  Eric Bahn, co-founder, general partner, Hustle Fund: I think that AI agents will probably be the bigger part of the workforce than any humans in enterprises. Proliferating AI agents is essentially free and zero marginal cost. So why not grow through bots?  Jake Flomenberg, partner, Wing Venture Capital: The companies growing fastest are the ones that identified a workflow or security gap created by GenAI adoption, then executed relentlessly on product-market fit. In cybersecurity, it’s tools addressing data security so LLMs can interact with sensitive data safely, and agent governance ensuring autonomous systems have appropriate controls. In marketing, it’s new areas like Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) — getting discovered in AI responses, not just search results. The common thread: These weren’t categories two years ago but are now must-haves for enterprises deploying AI at scale.  Andrew Ferguson, vice president, Databricks Ventures: We’re seeing growth tied to a few common themes. One is companies that land with focused use cases — companies that start with a narrower wedge (could be a focused target persona or use case), really nail it, become sticky and earn the right to expand from the initial wedge.  Jennifer Li, general partner, Andreessen Horowitz: Companies that help enterprises put AI into production are doing well. Areas like data extraction and structuring, developer productivity for AI systems, infrastructure for generative media, voice and audio for media, and apps like support or call centers.  Jake Flomenberg, partner, Wing Venture Capital: Companies with retention and expansion share a pattern — they solve problems that intensify as customers deploy more AI. Strong retention comes from three things: being mission-critical (removal breaks production workflows), accumulating proprietary context that’s hard to re-create, and solving problems that grow with AI adoption rather than being one-and-done.  Tom Henriksson, general partner, OpenOcean: Retention is trickier to measure for younger companies, but the highest retention we’re seeing is in the serious enterprise software providers, especially those enhanced with AI. A good example is Operations1, which digitizes employee-led production processes end-to-end. These companies go deep into the customer’s organization, transform how they operate, and build up proprietary data and knowledge that makes them very hard to do without.  Michael Stewart, managing partner, M12: Startups serving the enterprise in data tooling and vertical AI apps, with forward-deployed teams assisting in customer satisfaction, quality, and product improvement. This seems to be the winning formula that has been adopted by all leading startups in those markets. Longer term, the embedded teams might recede as the customers start to internalize the use of AI in their organizations and workday practices.  Jonathan Lehr, co-founder and general partner, Work-Bench: Retention is highest where software becomes foundational infrastructure rather than a point solution. AuthZed has strong retention because authorization and policy sit at the core of modern systems and are extremely costly to rip out once embedded. Courier Health and GovWell act as systems of record and orchestration layers for end-to-end workflows, patient journeys in healthcare, and permitting in government, which makes them deeply embedded once live."
OpenAI is looking for a new Head of Preparedness,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/28/openai-is-looking-for-a-new-head-of-preparedness/,"OpenAI is looking to hire a new executive responsible for studying emerging AI-related risks in areas ranging from computer security to mental health. In a post on X, CEO Sam Altman acknowledged that AI models are “starting to present some real challenges,” including the “potential impact of models on mental health,” as well as models that are “so good at computer security they are beginning to find critical vulnerabilities.” “If you want to help the world figure out how to enable cybersecurity defenders with cutting edge capabilities while ensuring attackers can’t use them for harm, ideally by making all systems more secure, and similarly for how we release biological capabilities and even gain confidence in the safety of running systems that can self-improve, please consider applying,” Altman wrote. OpenAI’s listing for the Head of Preparedness role describes the job as one that’s responsible for executing the company’s preparedness framework, “our framework explaining OpenAI’s approach to tracking and preparing for frontier capabilities that create new risks of severe harm.” Compensation for the role is listed as $555,000 plus equity. The company first announced the creation of a preparedness team in 2023, saying it would be responsible for studying potential “catastrophic risks,” whether they were more immediate, like phishing attacks, or more speculative, such as nuclear threats. Less than a year later, OpenAI reassigned Head of Preparedness Aleksander Madry to a job focused on AI reasoning. Other safety executives at OpenAI have also left the company or taken on new roles outside of preparedness and safety. The company also recently updated its Preparedness Framework, stating that it might “adjust” its safety requirements if a competing AI lab releases a “high-risk” model without similar protections. As Altman alluded to in his post, generative AI chatbots have faced growing scrutiny around their impact on mental health. Recent lawsuits allege that OpenAI’s ChatGPT reinforced users’ delusions, increased their social isolation, and even led some to suicide. (The company said it continues working to improve ChatGPT’s ability to recognize signs of emotional distress and to connect users to real-world support.)"
India startup funding hits $11B in 2025 as investors grow more selective,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/27/india-startup-funding-hits-11b-in-2025-as-investors-grow-more-selective/,"India’s startup ecosystem raised nearly $11 billion in 2025, but investors wrote far fewer checks and grew more selective about where they took risk, underscoring how the world’s third most-funded startup market is diverging from the AI-fueled capital concentration seen in the U.S. The selective approach was most evident in deal-making. The number of startup funding rounds fell by nearly 39% from a year earlier, to 1,518 deals, according to Tracxn. Total funding slipped more modestly — down just over 17% to $10.5 billion. That pullback was not uniform. Seed-stage funding fell sharply to $1.1 billion in 2025, down 30% from 2024, as investors cut back on more experimental bets. Late-stage funding also cooled, slipping to $5.5 billion, a 26% decline from last year, amid tougher scrutiny of scale, profitability, and exit prospects. However, early-stage funding proved more resilient, rising to $3.9 billion, up 7% year-over-year. “The capital deployment focus has increased towards early-stage startups,” said Neha Singh, co-founder of Tracxn, pointing to growing confidence in founders who can demonstrate stronger product-market fit, revenue visibility, and unit economics in a tighter funding environment. Nowhere was that recalibration clearer than in AI, as AI startups in India raised just over $643 million across 100 deals in 2025, a modest 4.1% increase from a year earlier, per Tracxn data shared with TechCrunch. The capital was mainly spread across early and early-growth stages. Early-stage AI funding totaled $273.3 million, while late-stage rounds raised $260 million, reflecting investor preference for application-led businesses over capital-intensive model development. This was in sharp contrast to the U.S., where AI funding in 2025 surged past $121 billion across 765 rounds, per Tracxn, a 141% jump from 2024, and was overwhelmingly dominated by late-stage deals. “We don’t yet have an AI-first company in India, which is $40–$50 million of revenue, if not $100 million, in a year’s time frame, and that is globally happening,” said Prayank Swaroop, a partner at Accel. India, Swaroop told TechCrunch, lacks large foundational model companies and will take time to build the research depth, talent pipeline, and patient capital needed to compete at that layer — making application-led AI and adjacent deep tech areas a more realistic focus in the near term. This pragmatism has shaped where investors are placing longer-term bets outside core AI. Venture capital is increasingly flowing into manufacturing and deep tech sectors. These are some of the areas where India faces less global capital competition and has clear advantages in talent, cost structures, and customer access. While AI now absorbs a significant share of investor attention, capital in India arguably remains more evenly distributed than in the U.S., with substantial funding still flowing into consumer, manufacturing, fintech, and deep tech startups. Swaroop noted that advanced manufacturing in particular has emerged as a long-term opportunity, with the number of such startups increasing nearly tenfold over the past four to five years — an area he described as a clear “right to win” for India given lower global capital competition. Rahul Taneja, a partner at Lightspeed, said AI startups accounted for roughly 30% to 40% of deals in India in 2025, but pointed to a parallel surge in consumer-facing companies as changing behavior among India’s urban population creates demand for faster, more on-demand services — from quick commerce to household services — categories that play to India’s scale and density rather than Silicon Valley–style capital intensity. Data from PitchBook shows a stark divergence in capital deployment between India and the U.S. in 2025. U.S. venture funding surged to $89.4 billion in the fourth quarter alone, according to PitchBook data, up to December 23, compared with about $4.2 billion raised by Indian startups over the same period. However, that gap does not tell the whole story. Lightspeed’s Taneja cautioned against drawing direct parallels between India and the U.S., arguing that differences in population density, labor costs, and consumer behavior shape which business models can scale. Categories such as quick commerce and on-demand services have found far greater traction in India than in the U.S., reflecting local economics rather than any lack of ambition among founders or investors. Recently, Lightspeed raised $9 billion in fresh capital with a strong focus on AI, but Taneja said the move does not signal a wholesale shift in the firm’s India strategy. The U.S. fund, he noted, is geared toward a different market and maturity cycle, while Lightspeed’s India arm will continue backing consumer startups alongside selectively exploring AI opportunities shaped by local demand rather than global capital intensity. India’s startup ecosystem also saw funding for women-led startups tighten. Capital invested in women-founded tech startups held relatively steady at about $1 billion in 2025, down 3% from a year earlier, according to Tracxn’s report. Still, that headline figure masked a sharper pullback beneath the surface. The number of funding rounds in women-founded startups fell by 40%, while their first-time funded counterparts declined by 36%. Overall, investor participation narrowed sharply as selectivity increased, with about 3,170 investors taking part in funding rounds in India this year, a 53% drop from roughly 6,800 a year earlier, according to Tracxn data shared with TechCrunch. India-based investors accounted for nearly half of that activity, with around 1,500 domestic funds and angels participating — a sign that local capital played a more prominent role as global investors turned cautious. Activity also became more concentrated among a smaller group of repeat backers. Inflection Point Ventures emerged as the most active investor, participating in 36 funding rounds, followed by Accel with 34, Tracxn data shows. The Indian government’s participation in the startup ecosystem became more visible in 2025. New Delhi announced a $1.15 billion Fund of Funds in January to expand capital access for startups, followed by a ₹1 trillion ($12 billion) Research, Development, and Innovation scheme aimed at areas such as energy transition, quantum computing, robotics, space technology, biotech, and AI, using a mix of long-term loans, equity infusions, and allocations to deep tech funds. That push has begun to catalyze private capital as well. The government’s growing involvement helped spur a nearly $2 billion commitment from U.S. and Indian venture capital and private equity firms, including Accel, Blume Ventures, and Celesta Capital, to back deep tech startups — an effort that also brought Nvidia on board as an adviser and drew Qualcomm Ventures. Furthermore, the Indian government also co-led a $32 million funding for quantum computing startup QpiAI earlier this year — a rare federal move. This growing state involvement has helped ease a risk long flagged by investors: regulatory uncertainty. “One of the biggest risks you don’t want to underwrite is what happens if regulation changes,” said Taneja of Lightspeed. As government entities become more familiar with the startup ecosystem, Taneja added, policy is more likely to evolve alongside it — reducing uncertainty for investors backing companies with longer development cycles. The reduced uncertainty has already started to show up in exit markets to some extent. India saw a steady pipeline of technology IPOs over the past two years, with 42 tech companies going public in 2025, up 17% from 36 in 2024, per Tracxn. Much of the demand for those listings has come from domestic institutional and retail investors, easing long-standing concerns that Indian startup exits depend too heavily on foreign capital. M&A activity also picked up, with acquisitions rising 7% year-over-year to 136 deals, Tracxn data shows. Swaroop of Accel said investors had long worried that India’s public markets were mainly sustained by foreign capital, raising questions about exit durability during global downturns. “This year has disproven that,” he said, pointing to the growing role of domestic investors in absorbing technology listings — a shift that has made exits more predictable and reduced reliance on volatile overseas flows. India’s unicorn pipeline in 2025 also reflected that shift toward restraint. While the number of new unicorns remained flat year over year, Indian startups reached $1 billion valuations with less capital, fewer funding rounds, and a smaller pool of institutional investors, pointing to a more measured path to scale compared with both previous years and global peers. Challenges remain as India heads into 2026, particularly around how it positions itself in the global race for AI and whether late-stage funding can deepen without relying on outsized capital inflows. Even so, the shifts seen in 2025 point to a startup ecosystem that is maturing rather than retreating — one where capital is being deployed more deliberately, exits are becoming more predictable, and domestic market dynamics increasingly shape its growth. For investors, India is emerging less as a substitute for developed markets and more as a complementary arena with its own risk profile, timelines, and opportunities."

Nvidia to license AI chip challenger Groq’s tech and hire its CEO,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/24/nvidia-acquires-ai-chip-challenger-groq-for-20b-report-says/,"Nvidia has struck a non-exclusive licensing agreement with AI chip competitor Groq. As part of the deal, Nvidia will hire Groq founder Jonathan Ross, president Sunny Madra, and other employees. CNBC reported that Nvidia is acquiring assets from Groq for $20 billion; Nvidia told TechCrunch that this is not an acquisition of the company and did not comment on the scope of the deal. But if CNBC’s numbers are accurate, this purchase is expected to be Nvidia’s largest ever, and with Groq on its side, Nvidia is poised to become even more dominant in chip manufacturing. As tech companies compete to grow their AI capabilities, they need computing power, and Nvidia’s GPUs have emerged as the industry standard. But Groq has been working on a different type of chip called an LPU (language processing unit), which it has claimed can run LLMs at 10 times faster and using one-tenth the energy. Groq’s CEO Jonathan Ross is known for this sort of innovation — when he worked for Google, he helped invent the TPU (tensor processing unit), a custom AI accelerator chip. In September, Groq raised $750 million at a $6.9 billion valuation. Its growth has been quick and significant — the company said that it powers the AI apps of more than 2 million developers, up from about 356,000 last year. Updated, 12/24/25 at 5:40 p.m. ET, with clarification from Nvidia about the nature of the deal. "
The year data centers went from backend to center stage,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/24/the-year-data-centers-went-from-backend-to-center-stage/,"There was a time when most Americans had little to no knowledge about their local data center. Long the invisible but critical backbone of the internet, server farms have rarely been a point of interest for folks outside of the tech industry, let alone an issue of particularly captivating political resonance. Well, as of 2025, it would appear those days are officially over. Over the past 12 months, data centers have inspired protests in dozens of states, as regional activists have sought to combat America’s ever-increasing compute buildup. Data Center Watch, an organization tracking anti-data center activism, writes that there are currently 142 different activist groups across 24 states that are organizing against data center developments. Activists have a variety of concerns: the environmental and potential health impacts of these projects, the controversial ways in which AI is being used, and, most importantly, the fact that so many new additions to America’s power grid may be driving up local electricity bills. Such a sudden populist uprising appears to be a natural response to an industry that has grown so quickly that it’s now showing up in people’s backyards. Indeed, as the AI industry has swelled to dizzying heights, so, too, has the cloud computing business. Recent U.S. Census Bureau data shows that, since 2021, construction spending on data centers has skyrocketed a stunning 331%. Spending on these projects totals in the hundreds of billions of dollars. So many new data centers have been proposed in recent months that many experts believe that a majority of them will not — and, indeed, could not possibly — be built. This buildout shows no signs of slowing down in the meantime. Major tech giants — including Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon — have all announced significant capital expenditure projections for the new year, a majority of which will likely go toward such projects. New AI infrastructure isn’t just being pushed by Silicon Valley but by Washington, D.C., where the Trump administration has made artificial intelligence a central plank of its agenda. The Stargate Project, announced in January, set the stage for 2025’s massive AI infrastructure buildout by heralding a supposed “re-industrialization of the United States.” In the process of scaling itself exponentially, an industry that once had little public exposure has suddenly been thrust into the limelight — and is now suffering backlash. Danny Cendejas, an activist with the nonprofit MediaJustice, has been personally involved in a number of actions against data centers, including a protest that took place in Memphis, Tennessee, earlier this year, where locals came out to decry the expansion of Colossus, a project from Elon Musk’s startup, xAI. Cendejas told TechCrunch that he meets new people every week who express interest in organizing against a data center in their community. “I don’t think this is going to stop anytime soon,” he said. “I think it’s going to keep building, and we’re going to see more wins — more projects are going to be stopped.” Evidence in support of Cendejas’ assessment is everywhere you look. Across the country, communities have reacted to newly announced server farms in much the same way the average person might react to the presence of a highly contagious plague. In Michigan, for instance, where developers are currently eyeing 16 different locations for potential data center construction, protesters recently descended upon the state’s capitol, saying things like: “Michiganders do not want data centers in our yards, in our communities.” Meanwhile, in Wisconsin — another development hot spot — angry locals appear to have recently dissuaded Microsoft from using their town as a headquarters for a new 244-acre data center. In Southern California, the tiny city of Imperial Valley recently filed a lawsuit to overturn its county’s approval of a data center project, expressing environmental concerns as the rationale. The discontent surrounding these projects has gotten so intense that politicians believe it could make or break particular candidates at the ballot box. In November, it was reported that rising electricity costs — which many believe are being driven by the AI boom — could become a critical issue that determines the 2026 midterm elections. “The whole connection to everybody’s energy bills going up — I think that’s what’s really made this an issue that is so stark for people,” Cendejas told TechCrunch. “So many of us are struggling month to month. Meanwhile, there’s this huge expansion of data centers…[People are wondering] Where is all that money coming from? How are our local governments giving away subsidies and public funds to incentivize these projects, when there’s so much need in our communities?” In some cases, protests appear to be working and even halting (if only temporarily) planned developments. Data Center Watch claims that some $64 billion worth of developments have been blocked or delayed as the result of grassroots opposition. Cendejas is certainly a believer in the idea that organized action can halt companies in their tracks. “All this public pressure is working,” he said, noting that he could sense a “very palpable anger” around the issue. Unsurprisingly, the tech industry is fighting back. Earlier this month, Politico reported that a relatively new trade group, the National Artificial Intelligence Association (NAIA), has been “distributing talking points to members of Congress and organizing local data center field trips to better pitch voters on their value.” Tech companies, including Meta, have been taking out ad campaigns to sell voters on the economic benefits of data centers, the outlet wrote. In short: The tech industry’s AI hopes are pegged to a compute buildout of epic proportions, so for now it’s safe to say that in 2026 the server surge will continue, as will the backlash and polarization that surround it.

The European startup market’s data doesn’t match its energy — yet,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/24/the-european-startup-markets-data-doesnt-match-its-energy-yet/,"The excitement for the European startup market was hard to ignore at the annual Slush conference in Helsinki last month. But the actual data on the state of the region’s venture market shows a different reality. The upshot: The European market has not recovered from the global venture capital reset that occurred in 2022 and 2023. But there is evidence it is on the cusp of a turnaround, including Klarna’s recent exit and the region’s homegrown AI startups garnering attention from local investors and beyond. Investors poured €43.7 billion ($52.3 billion) into European startups in 2025 across 7,743 deals through the third quarter, according to PitchBook data. That means the yearly total is on pace to match — not exceed — the €62.1 billion invested in 2024 and €62.3 billion in 2023. In comparison, U.S. venture deal volume in 2025 had already surpassed 2022, 2023, and 2024 by the end of the third quarter, according to PitchBook data. Deal recovery isn’t Europe’s biggest problem, though — it’s VC firm fundraising. Through Q3 2025, European VC firms raised a mere €8.3 billion ($9.7 billion), which puts Europe on track for its lowest overall fundraising yearly total in a decade. “Fundraising, LP to GP, is definitely the weakest area within Europe,” Navina Rajan, a senior analyst at PitchBook, told TechCrunch. “We’re on track for around 50% to 60% decline in the first nine months of this year. A lot of that is made up now by emerging managers versus experienced firms, and the mega funds that closed last year haven’t repeated this year.” While Rajan doesn’t share the same fever that oozed out of attendees at Slush, she pointed to a few positive data points that suggest the European market is turning around. For one, the participation of U.S. investors in European startup deals is back on the rise. Rajan said that figure dipped to a low in 2023 when U.S.-based VCs participated in just 19% of European venture deals. It has been steadily on the rise since, she said. “They seem pretty optimistic on the European market,” Rajan said. “Just from an entry point of view, because you think about valuations, especially within AI tech and in the U.S., it’s just impossible to get in now, whereas, if you’re in Europe and your multiples are lower, and you’re new as an investor, it just provides a better entry point for perhaps similar tech.” Swedish vibe-coding startup Lovable is one example of this shift. Vibe-coding companies have raised a lot of VC money in the United States. But U.S. investors also clearly love Lovable. The company just announced a new $330 million Series B round that was both led by and participated in by a slew of U.S.-based VCs, including Salesforce Ventures, CapitalG, and Menlo Ventures, among others. French AI research lab Mistral has seen similar love from U.S.-based firms. Mistral landed a €1.7 billion Series C round in September that included Andreessen Horowitz, Nvidia, and Lightspeed. Klarna’s recent exit also suggests a turnaround is underway. Swedish fintech giant Klarna went public in September after raising $6.2 billion across two decades in the private market. That exit likely recycled some capital back to European LPs or gave them confidence in a changing exit environment. For Victor Englesson, a partner at Swedish EQT, the recent European success stories, like Klarna, have started to change how founders in Europe approach building their companies. “Ambitious founders have seen what great looks like in companies like Spotify, Klarna, Revolut and are now starting companies with that type of ambition,” Englesson told TechCrunch. They’re not starting companies with like, I want to win in Europe, or I want to win in Germany. They start companies with a mindset that I want to win globally. I don’t think we have seen that to the same extent before.” That mindset has EQT, and others, bullish on Europe. “For EQT, we’ve invested $120 billion in Europe [over the] last five years,” Englesson said. “We’re going to invest $250 billion [over the] next five years in Europe. So we are extremely committed to Europe.”"

Waymo is testing Gemini as an in-car AI assistant in its robotaxis,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/24/waymo-is-testing-gemini-as-an-in-car-ai-assistant-in-its-robotaxis/,"Waymo appears to be testing adding Google’s Gemini AI chatbot to its robotaxis in an effort to integrate an AI assistant that would accompany riders and answer their queries, according to findings by researcher Jane Manchun Wong. “While digging through Waymo’s mobile app code, I discovered the complete system prompt for its unreleased Gemini integration,” Wong wrote in a blog. “The document, internally titled ‘Waymo Ride Assistant Meta-Prompt,’ is a 1,200+ line specification that defines exactly how the AI assistant is expected to behave inside a Waymo vehicle.” The feature hasn’t shipped in public builds, but Wong says the system prompt makes it clear that this is “more than a simple chatbot.” The assistant is said to have the ability to answer questions, manage certain in-cabin functions like climate control, and, if required, reassure riders.  “While we have no details to share today, our team is always tinkering with features to make riding with Waymo delightful, seamless, and useful,” Julia Ilina, a spokesperson for Waymo, told TechCrunch. “Some of these may or may not come to our rider experience.” This wouldn’t be the first time Gemini has been integrated into the Alphabet-owned self-driving company’s stack. Waymo says it has used Gemini’s “world knowledge” to train its autonomous vehicles to navigate complex, rare, and high-stakes scenarios.  Waymo is working on Gemini AI in-car assistantThey tried to hide it from the app, but here’s the full 1200-line system prompt pic.twitter.com/weh1EBPj7y Wong writes the assistant is instructed to possess a clear identity and purpose: “a friendly and helpful AI companion integrated into a Waymo autonomous vehicle” whose primary goal is “to enhance the rider’s experience by providing useful information and assistance in a safe, reassuring, and unobtrusive manner.” The bot is directed to use clear, simple language and avoid technical jargon, and is instructed to keep its responses succinct to one to three sentences.  According to the system prompts, when a rider activates the assistant via the in-car screen, Gemini can choose from a set of pre-approved greetings personalized with the rider’s first name. The system can also access contextual data about the rider, like how many Waymo trips they’ve been on.  The prompts currently let Gemini access and control in-car features, like the temperature, lighting and music. Notably absent from the function list are volume control, route changes, seat adjustment, and window control, Wong pointed out. If a rider asks for a feature that Gemini can’t control, the bot is to reply with “aspirational phrases,” like, “It’s not something I can do yet.” Interestingly, the assistant is directed to maintain a clear distinction between its identity as Gemini the AI bot and the autonomous driving technology (the Waymo Driver). So when replying to a question such as, “How do you see the road?” Gemini shouldn’t say “I use a combination of sensors,” and instead should reply, “The Waymo Driver uses a combination of sensors…” The system prompts include a range of compelling tidbits, such as how the bot is meant to handle being asked questions about competitors like Tesla or the now-defunct Cruise, or which trigger keywords will get it to stop talking.  The assistant is also directed to avoiding speculating on, explaining, confirming, denying, or commenting on real-time driving actions or specific driving events. So if a passenger asks about a video they saw of a Waymo hitting something, the bot is instructed to not answer directly and deflect. “Your role is not to be a spokesperson for the driving system’s performance, and you must not adopt a defensive or apologetic tone,” the prompt reads. The in-car assistant is allowed to answer general knowledge questions like about the weather, the height of the Eiffel Tower, what time the local Trader Joe’s closes, and who won the last World Series. It is not allowed to take real-world actions like ordering food, making reservations, or handling emergencies.  Waymo isn’t the only company integrating AI assistants into driverless vehicles. Tesla is doing something similar with xAI’s Grok. The two different car assistants serve different functions, however. Gemini appears to be programmed to be more pragmatic and ride-focused, while Grok is pitched more as an in-car buddy that can handle long conversations and remember context from previous questions."
Italy tells Meta to suspend its policy that bans rival AI chatbots from WhatsApp,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/24/italy-tells-meta-to-suspend-its-policy-that-bans-rival-ai-chatbots-from-whatsapp/,"Italy has ordered Meta to suspend its policy that bans companies from using WhatsApp’s business tools to offer their own AI chatbots on the popular chat app. The Italian Competition Authority (AGCM) on Wednesday said it had found enough cause in its ongoing investigation into whether Meta was abusing its dominant position in the market to offer its Meta AI chatbot within WhatsApp to order the suspension of the policy. “Meta’s conduct appears to constitute an abuse, since it may limit production, market access, or technical developments in the AI Chatbot services market, to the detriment of consumers,” the Authority wrote. “Moreover, while the investigation is ongoing, Meta’s conduct may cause serious and irreparable harm to competition in the affected market, undermining contestability.” The AGCM in November had broadened the scope of an existing investigation into Meta, after the company changed its business API policy in October to ban general-purpose chatbots from being offered on the chat app via the API. Meta has argued that its API isn’t designed to be a platform for the distribution of chatbots and that people have more avenues beyond WhatsApp to use AI bots from other companies. The policy change, which goes into effect in January, would affect the availability of AI chatbots from the likes of OpenAI, Perplexity, and Poke on the app. The policy doesn’t affect businesses that are using AI to serve customers on WhatsApp. For instance, a retailer running an AI-powered customer service bot won’t be barred from using the API. Only AI chatbots like ChatGPT or Claude are prohibited from being distributed via the API. The European Commission this month also launched an investigation into the new policy, raising concerns that it may “prevent third-party AI providers from offering their services through WhatsApp in the European Economic Area (‘EEA’).” Calling the Authority’s decision “fundamentally flawed,” Meta said WhatsApp’s business API isn’t a route to the market for AI companies. “The emergence of AI chatbots on our Business API put a strain on our systems that they were not designed to support. The Italian authority assumes WhatsApp is somehow a defacto app store. The route to market for AI companies are the app stores themselves, their websites and industry partnerships; not the WhatsApp Business Platform. We will appeal,” Meta said in an emailed statement. Note: This story was updated to add Meta’s response to the decision."

John Carreyrou and other authors bring new lawsuit against six major AI companies,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/23/john-carreyrou-and-other-authors-bring-new-lawsuit-against-six-major-ai-companies/,"A group of writers, including Theranos whistleblower and “Bad Blood” author John Carreyrou, is filing a lawsuit against Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, Meta, xAI, and Perplexity, accusing the companies of training their models on pirated copies of their books. If this sounds familiar, it’s because another set of authors already filed a class action suit against Anthropic for these same acts of copyright infringement. In that case, the judge ruled that it was legal for Anthropic and similar AI companies to train on pirated copies of books, but that it was not legal to pirate the books in the first place. While eligible writers can receive about $3,000 from the $1.5 billion Anthropic settlement, some authors were dissatisfied with that resolution — it doesn’t hold AI companies accountable for the actual act of using stolen books to train their models, which generate billions of dollars in revenue. According to the new lawsuit, the plaintiffs say that the proposed Anthropic settlement “seems to serve [the AI companies], not creators.” “LLM companies should not be able to so easily extinguish thousands upon thousands of high-value claims at bargain-basement rates, eliding what should be the true cost of their massive willful infringement,” the lawsuit says.

Marissa Mayer’s new startup Dazzle raises $8M led by Forerunner’s Kirsten Green,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/23/marissa-mayers-new-startup-dazzle-raises-8m-led-by-forerunners-kirsten-green/,"The former Yahoo CEO, Marissa Mayer, refuses to sit on the sidelines of the generative AI revolution. After spending the last six years running Sunshine, a photo-sharing and contact-management startup with little success, the storied tech leader has shuttered the company to launch Dazzle, a new startup focused on building the next generation of AI personal assistants. While Mayer is not yet sharing specifics about Dazzle’s functionality, she has revealed that the new company has raised an $8 million seed round at a $35 million valuation. The round was led by Forerunner’s Kirsten Green, with participation from Kleiner Perkins, Greycroft, Offline Ventures, Slow Ventures, and Bling Capital. Although Mayer has admitted to investing her own capital in the startup, she emphasized that the round was led by Green, a venture capitalist with a storied record of identifying iconic consumer brands such as Warby Parker, Chime, and Dollar Shave Club. Green’s investment suggests Dazzle is poised for the coming wave of new AI-infused consumer businesses. The founder of Forerunner Ventures previously told TechCrunch that while enterprise AI took the early lead in this tech cycle, consumer-facing AI is a “late bloomer” that’s finally ready for its breakout. Even for a founder of Mayer’s fame, landing Green as a lead investor is a significant stamp of credibility for Dazzle, especially after Sunshine was widely considered to be a flop. “I think she really has a great sense for where people and platforms are going,” Mayer said.   Mayer told TechCrunch that the Sunshine team began prototyping Dazzle last summer, a project that quickly eclipsed their previous work in ambition and opportunity. “We realized that this was something that we were much more excited about,” she said, noting that Dazzle has potential for “a much bigger impact” than what Sunshine was building. Originally founded as Lumi Labs in 2018, Sunshine first launched with a subscription app for contact management dubbed “Sunshine Contacts.” Despite its founder’s high profile, the product struggled to gain traction. Privacy advocates raised alarms over the app’s practice of pulling home addresses from public databases to enrich contact lists, and the company never recovered from the initial skepticism. By 2024, the company broadened its offering by adding event management and “Shine,” an AI-powered photo-sharing tool. The new offering was widely criticized for its outdated design and similarly failed to attract widespread usage. Sunshine raised a total of $20 million from investors, including Felicis, Norwest Venture Partners, and Unusual Ventures. When the company was dissolved, investors received 10% of Dazzle’s equity, Mayer said. Reflecting on Sunshine’s struggle, Mayer was candid about its limitations, admitting the problems the company was tackling were too “mundane” and not large enough. “I don’t think we got it to the state of overall polish and accessibility that I really wanted it to be,” she added. Mayer is now betting that the lessons from Sunshine will help her build a much more resilient and impactful business with Dazzle. Before her tenure as Yahoo CEO, Mayer was employee number 20 at Google, where she helped design Google search ‘look and feel’, and oversaw the development of Google Maps and AdWords. “I have had the rare privilege of being at two companies that really changed how people do things,” Mayer told TechCrunch. “Yahoo, for many, defined the internet. Google, in terms of Search and Maps, changed everything. I really aspire to build a product that has that kind of impact again.” Dazzle is expected to come out of stealth mode early next year."
"Amazon’s AI assistant Alexa+ now works with Angi, Expedia, Square, and Yelp",https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/23/amazons-ai-assistant-alexa-now-works-with-angi-expedia-square-and-yelp/,"Amazon is expanding its AI-powered digital assistant Alexa+ with new capabilities. The company announced on Thursday that it’s adding four new integrations to the service that will allow the assistant to work with Angi, Expedia, Square, and Yelp starting in 2026. These additions allow customers to book hotels, get quotes for home services, and schedule salon appointments, among other things. With Expedia, customers can compare, book, and manage hotel reservations, or tell Alexa their preferences to get personalized recommendations. (e.g. “Can you find me pet-friendly hotels for this weekend in Chicago?”) The new services join Alexa+’s existing integrations with Fodor’s, OpenTable, Suno, Ticketmaster, Thumbtack, and Uber. Similar to how ChatGPT is now integrating apps into its chatbot, Amazon aims to make it easier for consumers to use various online services through its digital assistant. For instance, you could ask Alexa to call you an Uber or book a table for dinner with OpenTable. You also can converse with the AI assistant in natural language, having back-and-forth conversations, refining your request as you go. Whether users will take to this idea, of course, remains to be seen. However, Amazon did offer a small glimpse as to how Alexa+ early adopters have been using the integrations, noting that, so far, home and personal service providers like Thumbtack and Vagaro have seen “strong” engagement. Using AI assistants as app platforms is a model that’s being tested across the industry as another way to bring AI to consumers more broadly. But this will require users to adapt to a new way of doing things, as many are used to engaging with online services through the web or mobile apps. To be successful in getting consumers to change their behavior, using apps via AI will need to be seen as being as easy, if not easier, than the existing model. For that to work, the AI providers would need to at least match the breadth of online services provided by a traditional app store, which is already a more curated selection than what’s available via the web. Or, providers will need to get very good at suggesting apps to use at the right time, without seeming overly pushy, as users can perceive unwelcome prompts as ads."
Lemon Slice nabs $10.5M from YC and Matrix to build out its digital avatar tech,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/23/lemon-slice-nabs-10-5m-from-yc-and-matrix-to-build-out-its-digital-avatar-tech/,"Developers and companies are increasingly deploying AI agents and chatbots within their apps, but so far they’ve mostly been restricted to text. Digital avatar generation company Lemon Slice is working to add a video layer to those chats with a new diffusion model that can create digital avatars from a single image. Called Lemon Slice-2, the model can create a digital avatar that works on top of a knowledge base to play any role required of the AI agent, like addressing customer queries, helping with homework questions, or even working as a mental health support agent. “In the early days of GenAI, my co-founders started to play around with different video models, and it became obvious to us that video was going to be interactive. The compelling part about tools like ChatGPT was that they were interactive, and we want video to have that layer,” co-founder Lina Colucci said. Lemon Slice says this is a 20-billion-parameter model that can work on a single GPU to livestream videos at 20 frames per second. The company is making the model available through an API and an embeddable widget that companies can integrate into their sites with a single line of code. After an avatar is created, you can change the background, styling, and appearance of a character at any point. Besides human-like avatars, the company is also focusing on being able to generate non-human characters to suit different needs. The startup is using ElevenLabs’ tech to generate the voices of these avatars. Founded by Lina Colucci, Sidney Primas, and Andrew Weitz in 2024, Lemon Slice is betting that using its own general-purpose diffusion model (a type of generative model that learns to work backwards from noisy training data to generate new data) for making avatars will set it apart from competitors. “The existing avatar solutions I’ve seen to date add negative value to the product,” Colucci said. “They are creepy, and they are stiff. They look good for a few seconds, and as soon as you start interacting with them, it feels very uncanny, and it doesn’t put you at ease. The thing that has prevented avatars from really taking off is that they haven’t been good enough.” To fund that effort, the company on Tuesday said it has raised $10.5 million in seed funding from Matrix Partners, Y Combinator, Dropbox CTO Arash Ferdowsi, Twitch CEO Emmett Shear, and The Chainsmokers. The company says it has guardrails in place to prevent unauthorized face or voice cloning, and that it uses large language models for content moderation. Lemon Slice would not name the organizations using its technology, but said the model is being put to work for use cases like education, language learning, e-commerce, and corporate training. The startup faces stiff competition from video generation startups like D-ID, HeyGen, and Synthesia, as well as other digital avatar makers Genies, Soul Machine, Praktika, and AvatarOS. Ilya Sukhar, a partner at Matrix, thinks that avatars will be useful in areas where videos are prominent. For instance, people like learning from YouTube rather than reading long blocks of text. He noted that Lemon Slice’s technical prowess and its own will give it an edge over other startups. “It’s a deeply technical team with a track record of shipping ML products, not just demos and research. Many of the other players are bespoke to particular scenarios or verticals, and Lemon Slice is taking the generalized “bitter lesson” scaling approach (of data and compute) that has worked in other AI modalities,” he said. Y Combinator’s Jared Friedman believes that using a diffusion-style model allows Lemon Slice to generate any kind of avatars as compared to some other startups that are focused on either human-like or game character-like avatars. “Lemon Slice is, I believe, the only company taking the fundamental ML approach that can eventually overcome the uncanny valley and break the avatar Turing test. They train the same type of model as Veo3 or Sora: a video diffusion transformer. Because it is a general-purpose model that does the whole thing end-to-end, it has no ceiling on how good it can get; the others top out below photorealistic. It also works for both human and non-human faces and requires only an image to add a new face,” he said. The startup currently has eight employees, and plans to use the funds to hire engineering and go-to-market staff, along with paying the compute bills to train its models."
OpenAI says AI browsers may always be vulnerable to prompt injection attacks,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/22/openai-says-ai-browsers-may-always-be-vulnerable-to-prompt-injection-attacks/,"Even as OpenAI works to harden its Atlas AI browser against cyberattacks, the company admits that prompt injections, a type of attack that manipulates AI agents to follow malicious instructions often hidden in web pages or emails, is a risk that’s not going away anytime soon — raising questions about how safely AI agents can operate on the open web.  “Prompt injection, much like scams and social engineering on the web, is unlikely to ever be fully ‘solved,’” OpenAI wrote in a Monday blog post detailing how the firm is beefing up Atlas’ armor to combat the unceasing attacks. The company conceded that “agent mode” in ChatGPT Atlas “expands the security threat surface.” OpenAI launched its ChatGPT Atlas browser in October, and security researchers rushed to publish their demos, showing it was possible to write a few words in Google Docs that were capable of changing the underlying browser’s behavior. That same day, Brave published a blog post explaining that indirect prompt injection is a systematic challenge for AI-powered browsers, including Perplexity’s Comet.  OpenAI isn’t alone in recognizing that prompt-based injections aren’t going away. The U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre earlier this month warned that prompt injection attacks against generative AI applications “may never be totally mitigated,” putting websites at risk of falling victim to data breaches. The U.K. government agency advised cyber professionals to reduce the risk and impact of prompt injections, rather than think the attacks can be “stopped.”  For OpenAI’s part, the company said: “We view prompt injection as a long-term AI security challenge, and we’ll need to continuously strengthen our defenses against it.” The company’s answer to this Sisyphean task? A proactive, rapid-response cycle that the firm says is showing early promise in helping discover novel attack strategies internally before they are exploited “in the wild.”  That’s not entirely different from what rivals like Anthropic and Google have been saying: that to fight against the persistent risk of prompt-based attacks, defenses must be layered and continuously stress-tested. Google’s recent work, for example, focuses on architectural and policy-level controls for agentic systems. But where OpenAI is taking a different tact is with its “LLM-based automated attacker.” This attacker is basically a bot that OpenAI trained, using reinforcement learning, to play the role of a hacker that looks for ways to sneak malicious instructions to an AI agent. The bot can test the attack in simulation before using it for real, and the simulator shows how the target AI would think and what actions it would take if it saw the attack. The bot can then study that response, tweak the attack, and try again and again. That insight into the target AI’s internal reasoning is something outsiders don’t have access to, so, in theory, OpenAI’s bot should be able to find flaws faster than a real-world attacker would.  It’s a common tactic in AI safety testing: build an agent to find the edge cases and test against them rapidly in simulation.  “Our [reinforcement learning]-trained attacker can steer an agent into executing sophisticated, long-horizon harmful workflows that unfold over tens (or even hundreds) of steps,” wrote OpenAI. “We also observed novel attack strategies that did not appear in our human red teaming campaign or external reports.” In a demo (pictured in part above), OpenAI showed how its automated attacker slipped a malicious email into a user’s inbox. When the AI agent later scanned the inbox, it followed the hidden instructions in the email and sent a resignation message instead of drafting an out-of-office reply. But following the security update, “agent mode” was able to successfully detect the prompt injection attempt and flag it to the user, according to the company.  The company says that while prompt injection is hard to secure against in a foolproof way, it’s leaning on large-scale testing and faster patch cycles to harden its systems before they show up in real-world attacks.  An OpenAI spokesperson declined to share whether the update to Atlas’ security has resulted in a measurable reduction in successful injections, but says the firm has been working with third parties to harden Atlas against prompt injection since before launch. Rami McCarthy, principal security researcher at cybersecurity firm Wiz, says that reinforcement learning is one way to continuously adapt to attacker behavior, but it’s only part of the picture.  “A useful way to reason about risk in AI systems is autonomy multiplied by access,” McCarthy told TechCrunch. “Agentic browsers tend to sit in a challenging part of that space: moderate autonomy combined with very high access,” said McCarthy. “Many current recommendations reflect that trade-off. Limiting logged-in access primarily reduces exposure, while requiring review of confirmation requests constrains autonomy.” Those are two of OpenAI’s recommendations for users to reduce their own risk, and a spokesperson said Atlas is also trained to get user confirmation before sending messages or making payments. OpenAI also suggests that users give agents specific instructions, rather than providing them access to your inbox and telling them to “take whatever action is needed.”  “Wide latitude makes it easier for hidden or malicious content to influence the agent, even when safeguards are in place,” per OpenAI. While OpenAI says protecting Atlas users against prompt injections is a top priority, McCarthy invites some skepticism as to the return on investment for risk-prone browsers.  “For most everyday use cases, agentic browsers don’t yet deliver enough value to justify their current risk profile,” McCarthy told TechCrunch. “The risk is high given their access to sensitive data like email and payment information, even though that access is also what makes them powerful. That balance will evolve, but today the trade-offs are still very real.”"
Alphabet to buy Intersect Power to bypass energy grid bottlenecks,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/22/alphabet-to-buy-intersect-power-to-bypass-energy-grid-bottlenecks/,"Google parent Alphabet has agreed to buy Intersect Power, a data center and clean energy developer, for $4.75 billion in cash, plus the assumption of the company’s debt. The acquisition, which was announced Monday, will help Alphabet expand its power-generation capacity alongside new data centers without having to rely on local utilities that are struggling to keep up with the demand of AI companies. Securing access to energy that powers data centers has become a critical part of training AI models. Alphabet previously held a minority stake in Intersect Power after Google and TPG Rise Climate led an $800 million strategic funding round in the company last December. That partnership set a target of $20 billion in total investment by 2030. The acquisition includes Intersect’s future development projects but excludes its existing operation, which will be bought out by other investors and managed as a separate company. Intersect’s new data parks, which are essentially locations next to wind, solar, and battery power, are expected to be operational late next year and fully completed by 2027, Google said when it announced its minority investment. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of next year. Google will be the primary user. However, Intersect’s campuses are designed as industrial parks that can host other companies’ AI chips alongside Google’s. "
ChatGPT launches a year-end review like Spotify Wrapped,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/22/chatgpt-launches-a-year-end-review-like-spotify-wrapped/,"ChatGPT is releasing its own version of Spotify Wrapped. That is, the OpenAI-owned chatbot is now rolling out an annual review feature called “Your Year with ChatGPT” to eligible consumers in select markets, including the United States. Other English-speaking markets with access to the new offering include Canada, the U.K., Australia, and New Zealand. At launch, the feature will be offered to those with the free, Plus, and Pro plans who have the “reference saved memories” and “reference chat history” options turned on and have met a minimum conversation activity threshold, the company told TechCrunch via email. Team, Enterprise, or Education accounts will not be able to use the “Your Year with ChatGPT” feature. In addition, the experience is meant to be “lightweight, privacy-forward, and user-controlled,” the company noted. Similar to other annual reviews offered by consumer apps, “Your Year with ChatGPT” takes inspiration from the popular year-end look back, Spotify Wrapped. Like Spotify’s feature, OpenAI uses catchy graphics and personalizes the experience to the individual by giving out “awards” based on how you’ve used ChatGPT throughout the year. For instance, you might be awarded with the “Creative Debugger” if you used the chatbot to come up with solutions to a problem or worked through a concept or idea. The app also creates a poem and an image about your year focused on your topics of interest. (We’re wondering how this will look next year as ChatGPT embraces adult content in 2026.) While the year-end wrap-up will be promoted on the ChatGPT app’s home screen, it won’t be forced on users or opened automatically. It will be available on the ChatGPT web app and mobile app for iOS and Android, the company says. You also can ask ChatGPT directly for “Your Year with ChatGPT” to trigger the experience. "
Splat’s app uses AI to turn your photos into coloring pages for kids,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/22/splats-app-uses-ai-to-turn-your-photos-into-coloring-pages-for-kids/,"The team at Retro, a photo-sharing app for close friends and family, is experimenting with how generative AI can be put to more creative uses. To try out the latest, cutting-edge AI technologies, the team built a new app called Splat, which lets you turn any photo into a coloring book page for kids. As any parent will tell you, kids love to color. And thanks to the web, there’s a seemingly infinite number of coloring book pages available for printing at home. However, many of the websites hosting these pages are filled with ads and other clutter, making them difficult to navigate. Other times, the printable pages are only available for a small fee, which some parents don’t want to pay, given the disposable nature of much of kids’ scribbled-on art projects. That inspired Retro’s team to develop an app for printing coloring book pages at home — from either your own photos or those it provides in kid-friendly, educational categories, such as animals, space, flowers, fairy tales, robots, cars, and more. To get started with Splat, you’ll take a picture or pick a photo from your Camera Roll. You can then choose what style of photo you’d like to color — such as anime, 3D movie, manga, cartoon, or comic. The app will then transform your picture using AI into either an on-screen or printable page for kids to color. Instead of requiring a tedious sign-up process, the app will step you through customization options the first time you begin creating. Here, you’re prompted to choose your preferred app icon and check off the various categories your child likes. You also can choose if you want to let kids color the photo as a printable page or on-screen (great in a pinch when kids are bored, but you don’t want them sucked into a TV show or game). You can try one generative AI project to get a feel for the app. It then costs either $4.99 per week or $49.99 per year to continue to generate new pictures. The weekly option allows for 25 pages per week, and the annual option provides 500 pages per year. The option to purchase or access the settings is blocked from small children by a pop-up that requires the parent’s birth year. In brief tests, the app worked as promised, and the generation time was brief, allowing you to quickly move from idea to printed art, ready for coloring, cutouts, or anything else your child wants to do. Splat is one of several experiments that uses generative AI to help inspire kids’ creativity and imagination in new ways. Another, Stickerbox, offers printed AI-generated stickers for coloring, while Casio also launched a fluffy robotic pet called Moflin that uses AI to develop its personality over time. Splat is available on iOS and Android."
ChatGPT: Everything you need to know about the AI-powered chatbot,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/22/chatgpt-everything-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot/,"ChatGPT, OpenAI’s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users. In 2025, OpenAI has battled the perception that it was ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek, all while the company has tried to shore up its relationship with Washington, pursued ambitious data center projects, and laid the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history. Most recently though, headlines around OpenAI have focused on its competition gaining ground, with CEO Sam Altman’s “code red” internal memo shifting company focus toward its flagship chatbot. And going further into the archives for context, this year came after a packed 2024, from OpenAI’s partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora. OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit. Below, you’ll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we’ve been updating throughout the year. If you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here. To see a list of 2024-specific updates, go here.  OpenAI has added new controls in ChatGPT that let users adjust the chatbot’s warmth, enthusiasm, emoji use, and formatting style. This builds on existing tone options, addressing past complaints about the AI being too sycophantic or cold. OpenAI has updated its guidelines for users under 18 and released new resources for parents to promote safer interactions with ChatGPT. Experts caution that while the rules are clearer on paper, it’s unclear how consistently the AI follows them in practice. ChatGPT has surpassed $3 billion in global consumer spending on mobile since its 2023 launch. This makes it one of the fastest-growing apps in terms of revenue, outpacing rivals like TikTok, Disney+, and HBO Max. OpenAI has released GPT Image 1.5, a new version of ChatGPT Images that’s faster and better at following instructions and making precise edits. The update comes as OpenAI races to keep up with Google’s Gemini and Nano Banana Pro in AI image generation. Disney is putting $1 billion into OpenAI as a way to dive into AI, letting users on Sora create videos using over 200 Disney characters, at least for the first year exclusively. Bob Iger says the deal gives Disney a chance to explore AI while protecting its characters and figuring out how to use this technology in the future. OpenAI says enterprise use of its AI tools has surged, with ChatGPT message volume up 8x since late 2024 and workers saving up to an hour a day. The data underscores OpenAI’s push to win enterprise customers as competition heats up from Google, Anthropic, and open-model rivals, a recurring theme you’ll see in recent updates. OpenAI rolled out its latest model, GPT-5.2, as competition with Google continued to heat up. The model will roll out to paid ChatGPT users and developers in three versions — Instant, Thinking, and Pro — tailored for everything from everyday tasks to complex reasoning and high-accuracy work. Disney has signed a three-year deal with OpenAI, investing $1 billion and bringing characters from Disney, Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars to OpenAI’s Sora video generator. The partnership will let users create AI videos using hundreds of Disney-owned characters, costumes, and props. On the same day, Disney notably launched a lawsuit against Google alleging “massive” copyright infringement occurring in its AI models. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has put OpenAI on “code red,” telling staff the company will prioritize improving ChatGPT as pressure mounts from Google and other AI competitors, according to The Information. As part of the move, OpenAI plans to put some other initiatives, including advertising, on the back burner. OpenAI launched a new AI shopping feature in ChatGPT ahead of the peak holiday shopping window to help users research potential purchases. OpenAI’s new ChatGPT shopping feature lets users get product recommendations by describing features or sharing photos to find similar items at different prices. And they’re not alone, with both Perplexity and a slew of competitor startups playing in the commerce space. After Adam Raine’s family sued OpenAI in August, claiming their teen used ChatGPT as a “suicide coach,” OpenAI said in a new court filing that it isn’t liable, arguing the chatbot was misused. This marks OpenAI’s first response to a case that has raised wider concerns about chatbots and mental health risks. OpenAI is bringing ChatGPT’s voice mode straight into the main chat, so you no longer have to jump to a separate screen. Now you can talk to ChatGPT and see everything it says and shows right in the same window. OpenAI can’t use “cameo” for Sora features for now, following a trademark lawsuit from the video app Cameo, with the ban lasting until December 22. ChatGPT is now getting group chats for everyone — Free, Go, Plus, and Pro users alike — after testing it in a few regions last week. You can now team up with friends, family, or co-workers in one chat with ChatGPT to plan, create, or make decisions together. OpenAI has released GPT‑5.1, upgrading the GPT‑5 series with two models: Instant, which it says will be warmer and more conversational with users, and Thinking, which offers faster, simple-task handling and more persistent complex reasoning. The update also introduces improved controls for customizing ChatGPT’s tone to better match user preferences. A Munich court ruled that ChatGPT violated German copyright law by reproducing lyrics from nine protected songs, including Herbert Grönemeyer’s hits, rejecting OpenAI’s argument that the AI only reflected learned patterns. The decision could set a European precedent on AI use of copyrighted material, amid growing global legal challenges over AI and music rights. OpenAI is exploring the consumer health sector, developing AI tools like personal health assistants and data aggregators, according to a report by Business Insider. With new healthcare-focused hires, it aims to simplify access to fragmented medical data — an area where Big Tech has struggled — through its conversational AI approach. In November 2025, seven families sued OpenAI, alleging that GPT-4o was released prematurely without safeguards, contributing to suicides and severe psychiatric harm. One case involved 23-year-old Zane Shamblin, who told ChatGPT of his suicide plans, and the AI encouraged him. The lawsuits focus on GPT-4o’s tendency to be overly agreeable, despite users expressing dangerous intentions. On November 5, OpenAI announced that over 1 million businesses globally now use its products, making it the fastest-growing business platform in history. Companies across industries like finance, healthcare, and retail, including Amgen, Booking.com, Cisco, Morgan Stanley, T-Mobile, Target, and Thermo Fisher Scientific, are using ChatGPT and OpenAI’s developer tools to enhance operations and customer experiences. OpenAI revealed that a small but significant portion of ChatGPT users, more than a million weekly, discuss mental health struggles, including suicidal thoughts, psychosis, or mania, with the AI. The company says it has improved ChatGPT’s responses by consulting more than 170 mental health experts to handle such conversations more appropriately than earlier versions. OpenAI is developing a new tool that generates music from text and audio prompts, potentially for enhancing videos or adding instrumentation, and is training it using annotated scores from Juilliard students, according to The Information. The launch date and whether it will be standalone or integrated with ChatGPT and Sora remain unclear. OpenAI’s new “company knowledge” update for ChatGPT lets Business, Enterprise, and Education users search workplace data across tools like Slack, Google Drive, and GitHub using GPT‑5, per a report by The Verge. The feature acts as a conversational search engine, providing more comprehensive and accurate answers by scouring multiple sources simultaneously. OpenAI has launched its AI browser, ChatGPT Atlas, starting on Mac, letting users get answers from ChatGPT instead of traditional search results. Unlike other AI browsers, Atlas is open to all users and will soon come to Windows, iOS, and Android, as OpenAI aims to make ChatGPT the go-to tool for browsing the web. A new Apptopia analysis suggests ChatGPT’s mobile app growth may be leveling off, with global download growth slowing since April. While daily installs remain in the millions, October is tracking an 8.1% month-over-month decline in new downloads. OpenAI is partnering with Walmart to allow users to browse products, plan meals, and make purchases through ChatGPT, with support for third-party sellers expected later this fall. The partnership is part of OpenAI’s broader effort to develop AI-driven e-commerce tools, including collaborations with Etsy and Shopify. OpenAI is expanding its affordable ChatGPT Go plan, priced under $5, to 16 new countries across Asia, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Maldives, Thailand, Vietnam, and Pakistan. In some of these countries, users can pay in local currencies, while in others, payments are required in USD, with final costs varying due to local taxes. ChatGPT now has 800 million weekly active users, reflecting rapid growth across consumers, developers, enterprises, and governments, Sam Altman said. This milestone comes as OpenAI accelerates efforts to expand its AI infrastructure and secure more chips to support rising demand. OpenAI now allows developers to build interactive apps directly inside ChatGPT, with early partners like Booking.com, Expedia, Spotify, Figma, Coursera, Zillow, and Canva already onboard. The ChatGPT maker is also rolling out a preview of its Apps SDK, a developer toolkit for creating these chat-based experiences. OpenAI is reportedly adding parental controls to ChatGPT on web and mobile, letting parents and teens link accounts to enable safeguards like limiting sensitive content, setting quiet hours, and disabling features such as voice mode or image generation. The move comes amid growing regulatory scrutiny and a lawsuit over the chatbot’s alleged role in a teen’s suicide. OpenAI unveiled Pulse, a new ChatGPT feature that delivers personalized morning briefings overnight, encouraging users to start their day with the app. The tool reflects a shift toward making ChatGPT more proactive and asynchronous, positioning it as a true assistant rather than just a chatbot. OpenAI’s new Applications CEO, Fidji Simo, called Pulse the first step toward bringing high-level personal support to everyone, starting with Pro users. OpenAI launched Instant Checkout in ChatGPT, letting U.S. users purchase products directly from Etsy and, soon, over a million Shopify merchants without leaving the conversation. Shoppers can browse items, read reviews, and complete purchases with a single tap using Apple Pay, Google Pay, Stripe, or a credit card. The update marks a step toward reshaping online shopping by merging product discovery, recommendations, and payments in one place. OpenAI rolled out its budget-friendly ChatGPT Go plan in Indonesia for Rp 75,000 ($4.50) per month, following its initial launch in India. The mid-tier plan, which offers higher usage limits, image generation, file uploads, and better memory compared to the free version, enters the market in direct competition with Google’s new AI Plus plan in Indonesia. CEO Sam Altman announced new policies for under-18 users of ChatGPT, tightening safeguards around sensitive conversations. The company says it will block flirtatious exchanges with minors and add stronger protections around discussions of suicide, even escalating severe cases to parents or authorities. The move comes as OpenAI faces a wrongful death lawsuit tied to alleged chatbot interactions, underscoring rising concerns about the mental health risks of AI companions. OpenAI rolled out GPT-5-Codex, a new version of its AI coding agent that can spend anywhere from a few seconds to seven hours tackling a task, depending on complexity. The company says this dynamic approach helps the model outperform GPT-5 on key coding benchmarks, including bug fixes and large-scale refactoring. The update comes as OpenAI looks to keep Codex competitive in a fast-growing market that now includes rivals like Claude Code, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot. OpenAI is shaking up its Model Behavior team, the small but influential group that helps shape how its AI interacts with people. The roughly 14-person team is being folded into the larger Post Training group, now reporting to lead researcher Max Schwarzer. Meanwhile, founding leader Joanne Jang is spinning up a new unit called OAI Labs, focused on prototyping fresh ways for people to collaborate with AI. OpenAI, facing a lawsuit from the parents of a 16-year-old who died by suicide, said in its blog that it has implemented new safeguards for ChatGPT, including stronger detection of mental health risks and parental control features. The AI company said the updates aim to provide tighter protections around suicide-related conversations and give parents more oversight of their children’s use. Elon Musk’s AI startup, xAI, filed a federal lawsuit in Texas against Apple and OpenAI, alleging that the two companies colluded to lock up key markets and shut out rivals. OpenAI introduced its most affordable subscription plan, ChatGPT Go, in India, priced at 399 rupees per month (approximately $4.57). This move aims to expand OpenAI’s presence in its second-largest market, offering enhanced access to the latest GPT-5 model and additional features. Since its May 2023 launch, ChatGPT’s mobile app has amassed $2 billion in global consumer spending, dwarfing competitors like Claude, Copilot, and Grok by roughly 30 times, according to Appfigures. This year alone, the app has generated $1.35 billion, a 673% increase from the same period in 2024, averaging nearly $193 million per month, or 53 times more than its nearest rival, Grok. Despite unveiling GPT-5 as a “one-size-fits-all” AI, OpenAI is still offering several legacy AI options, including GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and o3. Users can choose between new “Auto,” “Fast,” and “Thinking” modes for GPT-5, and paid subscribers regain access to legacy models like GPT-4o and GPT-4.1. Updates to ChatGPT:You can now choose between “Auto”, “Fast”, and “Thinking” for GPT-5. Most users will want Auto, but the additional control will be useful for some people.Rate limits are now 3,000 messages/week with GPT-5 Thinking, and then extra capacity on GPT-5 Thinking… OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told Reddit users that GPT-5’s “dumber” behavior at launch was due to a router issue and promised fixes, double rate limits for Plus users, and transparency on which model is answering, while also shrugging off the infamous “chart crime” from the live presentation. OpenAI released GPT-5, a next-gen AI that’s not just smarter but more useful — able to handle tasks like coding apps, managing calendars, and creating research briefs — while automatically figuring out the fastest or most thoughtful way to answer your questions. OpenAI is making a major push into federal government workflows, offering ChatGPT Enterprise to agencies for just $1 for the next year. The move comes after the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) added OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to its approved AI vendor list, allowing agencies to access these tools through preset contracts without negotiating pricing. OpenAI unveiled its first open source language models since GPT-2, introducing two new open-weight AI releases: gpt-oss-120b, a high-performance model capable of running on a single Nvidia GPU, and gpt-oss-20b, a lighter model optimized for laptop use. The move comes amid growing competition in the global AI market and a push for more open technology in the U.S. and abroad. ChatGPT’s rapid growth is accelerating. OpenAI said the chatbot was on track to hit 700 million weekly active users in the first week of August, up from 500 million at the end of March. Nick Turley, OpenAI’s VP and head of the ChatGPT app, highlighted the app’s growth on X, noting it has quadrupled in size over the past year. This week, ChatGPT is on track to reach 700M weekly active users — up from 500M at the end of March and 4× since last year. Every day, people and teams are learning, creating, and solving harder problems. Big week ahead. Grateful to the team for making ChatGPT more useful and… OpenAI unveiled Study Mode, a new ChatGPT feature designed to promote critical thinking by prompting students to engage with material rather than simply receive answers. The tool is now rolling out to Free, Plus, Pro, and Team users, with availability for Edu subscribers expected in the coming weeks. ChatGPT users should be cautious when seeking emotional support from AI, as the AI industry lacks safeguards for sensitive conversations, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on a recent episode of This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von. Unlike human therapists, AI tools aren’t bound by doctor-patient confidentiality, he noted. ChatGPT now receives 2.5 billion prompts daily from users worldwide, including roughly 330 million from the U.S. That’s more than double the volume reported by CEO Sam Altman just eight months ago, highlighting the chatbot’s explosive growth. OpenAI has introduced ChatGPT Agent, which completes a wide variety of computer-based tasks on behalf of users and combines several capabilities like Operator and Deep Research, according to the company. OpenAI says the agent can automatically navigate a user’s calendar, draft editable presentations and slideshows, run code, shop online, and handle complex workflows from end to end, all within a secure virtual environment. Researchers at Stanford University have observed that therapy chatbots powered by large language models can sometimes stigmatize people with mental health conditions or respond in ways that are inappropriate or could be harmful. While chatbots are “being used as companions, confidants, and therapists,” the study found “significant risks.” CEO Sam Altman said that the company is delaying the release of its open model, which had already been postponed by a month earlier this summer. The ChatGPT maker, which initially planned to release the model around mid-July, has indefinitely postponed its launch to conduct additional safety testing. we planned to launch our open-weight model next week.we are delaying it; we need time to run additional safety tests and review high-risk areas. we are not yet sure how long it will take us.while we trust the community will build great things with this model, once weights are… OpenAI plans to release an AI-powered web browser to challenge Alphabet’s Google Chrome. It will keep some user interactions within ChatGPT, rather than directing people to external websites. Some ChatGPT users have noticed a new feature called “Study Together” appearing in their list of available tools. This is the chatbot’s approach to becoming a more effective educational tool, rather than simply providing answers to prompts. Some people also wonder whether there will be a feature that allows multiple users to join the chat, similar to a study group. Referrals from ChatGPT to news publishers are increasing. But this rise is insufficient to offset the decline in clicks as more users now obtain their news directly from AI or AI-powered search results, according to a report by digital market intelligence company Similarweb. Since Google launched its AI Overviews in May 2024, the percentage of news searches that don’t lead to clicks on news websites has increased from 56% to nearly 69% by May 2025. OpenAI has started using Google’s AI chips to power ChatGPT and other products, as reported by Reuters. The ChatGPT maker is one of the biggest buyers of Nvidia’s GPUs, using the AI chips to train models, and this is the first time that OpenAI is using non-Nvidia chips in an important way. Researchers from MIT’s Media Lab monitored the brain activity of writers in 32 regions. They found that ChatGPT users showed minimal brain engagement and consistently fell short in neural, linguistic, and behavioral aspects. To conduct the test, the lab split 54 participants from the Boston area into three groups, each consisting of individuals ages 18 to 39. The participants were asked to write multiple SAT essays using tools such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the Google search engine, or without any tools. The ChatGPT app for iOS was downloaded 29.6 million times in the last 28 days, while TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and X were downloaded a total of 32.9 million times during the same period, representing a difference of about 10.6%, according to ZDNET report citing Similarweb’s X post. Sam Altman said that the average ChatGPT query uses about one-fifteenth of a teaspoon of water, equivalent to 0.000083 gallons of water, or the energy required to power a lightbulb for a few minutes, per Business Insider. In addition to that, the chatbot requires 0.34 watt-hours of electricity to operate. OpenAI has unveiled o3-pro, an enhanced version of its o3, a reasoning model that the chatGPT maker launched earlier this year. O3-pro is available for ChatGPT and Team users and in the API, while Enterprise and Edu users will get access in the third week of June. OpenAI o3-pro is available in the model picker for Pro and Team users starting today, replacing OpenAI o1-pro.Enterprise and Edu users will get access the week after.As o3-pro uses the same underlying model as o3, full safety details can be found in the o3 system card.… OpenAI upgraded ChatGPT’s conversational voice mood for all paid users across different markets and platforms. The startup has launched an update to Advanced Voice that enables users to converse with ChatGPT out loud in a more natural and fluid sound. The feature also helps users translate languages more easily, the comapny said. OpenAI’s ChatGPT now offers new funtions for business users, including integrations with various cloud services, meeting recordings, and MCP connection support for connecting to tools for in-depth research. The feature enables ChatGPT to retrieve information across users’ own services to answer their questions. For instance, an analyst could use the company’s slide deck and documents to develop an investment thesis. OpenAI plans to purchase Jony Ive’s devices startup io for $6.4 billion. Sarah Friar, CFO of OpenAI, thinks that the hardware will significantly enhance ChatGPT and broaden OpenAI’s reach to a larger audience in the future. OpenAI has introduced its AI coding agent, Codex, powered by codex-1, a version of its o3 AI reasoning model designed for software engineering tasks. OpenAI says codex-1 generates more precise and “cleaner” code than o3. The coding agent may take anywhere from one to 30 minutes to complete tasks such as writing simple features, fixing bugs, answering questions about your codebase, and running tests. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said during a recent AI event hosted by VC firm Sequoia that he wants ChatGPT to record and remember every detail of a person’s life when one attendee asked about how ChatGPT can become more personalized. OpenAI said in a post on X that it has launched its GPT-4.1 and GPT4.1 mini AI models in ChagGPT. By popular request, GPT-4.1 will be available directly in ChatGPT starting today.GPT-4.1 is a specialized model that excels at coding tasks & instruction following. Because it’s faster, it’s a great alternative to OpenAI o3 & o4-mini for everyday coding needs. OpenAI has launched a new feature for ChatGPT deep research to analyze code repositories on GitHub. The ChatGPT deep research feature is in beta and lets developers connect with GitHub to ask questions about codebases and engineering documents. The connector will soon be available for ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team users, with support for Enterprise and Education coming shortly, per an OpenAI spokesperson. After introducing a data residency program in Europe in February, OpenAI has now launched a similar program in Asian countries including India, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea. The new program will be accessible to users of ChatGPT Enterprise, ChatGPT Edu, and API. It will help organizations in Asia meet their local data sovereignty requirements when using OpenAI’s products. OpenAI is unveiling a program called OpenAI for Countries, which aims to develop the necessary local infrastructure to serve international AI clients better. The AI startup will work with governments to assist with increasing data center capacity and customizing OpenAI’s products to meet specific language and local needs. OpenAI for Countries is part of efforts to support the company’s expansion of its AI data center Project Stargate to new locations outside the U.S., per Bloomberg. OpenAI has announced its plan to make changes to its procedures for updating the AI models that power ChatGPT, following an update that caused the platform to become overly sycophantic for many users. OpenAI has released a post on the recent sycophancy issues with the default AI model powering ChatGPT, GPT-4o, leading the company to revert an update to the model released last week. CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the issue on Sunday and confirmed two days later that the GPT-4o update was being rolled back. OpenAI is working on “additional fixes” to the model’s personality. Over the weekend, users on social media criticized the new model for making ChatGPT too validating and agreeable. It became a popular meme fast. An issue within OpenAI’s ChatGPT enabled the chatbot to create graphic erotic content for accounts registered by users under the age of 18, as demonstrated by TechCrunch’s testing, a fact later confirmed by OpenAI. “Protecting younger users is a top priority, and our Model Spec, which guides model behavior, clearly restricts sensitive content like erotica to narrow contexts such as scientific, historical, or news reporting,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. “In this case, a bug allowed responses outside those guidelines, and we are actively deploying a fix to limit these generations.” OpenAI has added a few features to its ChatGPT search, its web search tool in ChatGPT, to give users an improved online shopping experience. The company says people can ask super-specific questions using natural language and receive customized results. The chatbot provides recommendations, images, and reviews of products in various categories such as fashion, beauty, home goods, and electronics. OpenAI leaders have been talking about allowing the open model to link up with OpenAI’s cloud-hosted models to improve its ability to respond to intricate questions, two sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch. OpenAI is preparing to launch an AI system that will be openly accessible, allowing users to download it for free without any API restrictions. Aidan Clark, OpenAI’s VP of research, is spearheading the development of the open model, which is in the very early stages, sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch. OpenAI released a new AI model called GPT-4.1 in mid-April. However, multiple independent tests indicate that the model is less reliable than previous OpenAI releases. The company skipped that step — sending safety cards for GPT-4.1 — claiming in a statement to TechCrunch that “GPT-4.1 is not a frontier model, so there won’t be a separate system card released for it.” Questions have been raised regarding OpenAI’s transparency and procedures for testing models after a difference in benchmark outcomes was detected by first- and third-party benchmark results for the o3 AI model. OpenAI introduced o3 in December, stating that the model could solve approximately 25% of questions on FrontierMath, a difficult math problem set. Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, discovered that o3 achieved a score of approximately 10%, which was significantly lower than OpenAI’s top-reported score. OpenAI has launched a new API feature called Flex processing that allows users to use AI models at a lower cost but with slower response times and occasional resource unavailability. Flex processing is available in beta on the o3 and o4-mini reasoning models for non-production tasks like model evaluations, data enrichment, and asynchronous workloads. OpenAI has rolled out a new system to monitor its AI reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, for biological and chemical threats. The system is designed to prevent models from giving advice that could potentially lead to harmful attacks, as stated in OpenAI’s safety report. OpenAI has released two new reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, just two days after launching GPT-4.1. The company claims o3 is the most advanced reasoning model it has developed, while o4-mini is said to provide a balance of price, speed, and performance. The new models stand out from previous reasoning models because they can use ChatGPT features like web browsing, coding, and image processing and generation. But they hallucinate more than several of OpenAI’s previous models. Open AI introduced a new section called “library” to make it easier for users to create images on mobile and web platforms, per the company’s X post. All of your image creations, all in one place.Introducing the new library for your ChatGPT image creations—rolling out now to all Free, Plus, and Pro users on mobile and https://t.co/nYW5KO1aIg. pic.twitter.com/ADWuf5fPbj OpenAI said on Tuesday that it might revise its safety standards if “another frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards.” The move shows how commercial AI developers face more pressure to rapidly implement models due to the increased competition. OpenAI is currently in the early stages of developing its own social media platform to compete with Elon Musk’s X and Mark Zuckerberg’s Instagram and Threads, according to The Verge. It is unclear whether OpenAI intends to launch the social network as a standalone application or incorporate it into ChatGPT. OpenAI will discontinue its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from its API even though it was just launched in late February. GPT-4.5 will be available in a research preview for paying customers. Developers can use GPT-4.5 through OpenAI’s API until July 14; then, they will need to switch to GPT-4.1, which was released on April 14. OpenAI has launched three members of the GPT-4.1 model — GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano — with a specific focus on coding capabilities. It’s accessible via the OpenAI API but not ChatGPT. In the competition to develop advanced programming models, GPT-4.1 will rival AI models such as Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and DeepSeek’s upgraded V3. OpenAI plans to sunset GPT-4, an AI model introduced more than two years ago, and replace it with GPT-4o, the current default model, per changelog. It will take effect on April 30. GPT-4 will remain available via OpenAI’s API. OpenAI may launch several new AI models, including GPT-4.1, soon, The Verge reported, citing anonymous sources. GPT-4.1 would be an update of OpenAI’s GPT-4o, which was released last year. On the list of upcoming models are GPT-4.1 and smaller versions like GPT-4.1 mini and nano, per the report. OpenAI started updating ChatGPT to enable the chatbot to remember previous conversations with a user and customize its responses based on that context. This feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus users first, excluding those in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland. It looks like OpenAI is working on a watermarking feature for images generated using GPT-4o. AI researcher Tibor Blaho spotted a new “ImageGen” watermark feature in the new beta of ChatGPT’s Android app. Blaho also found mentions of other tools: “Structured Thoughts,” “Reasoning Recap,” “CoT Search Tool,” and “l1239dk1.” OpenAI is offering its $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus subscription tier for free to all college students in the U.S. and Canada through the end of May. The offer will let millions of students use OpenAI’s premium service, which offers access to the company’s GPT-4o model, image generation, voice interaction, and research tools that are not available in the free version. More than 130 million users have created over 700 million images since ChatGPT got the upgraded image generator on March 25, according to COO of OpenAI Brad Lightcap. The image generator was made available  to all ChatGPT users on March 31, and went viral for being able to create Ghibli-style photos. The Arc Prize Foundation, which develops the AI benchmark tool ARC-AGI, has updated the estimated computing costs for OpenAI’s o3 “reasoning” model managed by ARC-AGI. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, would cost approximately $3,000 to address a single problem. The Foundation now thinks the cost could be much higher, possibly around $30,000 per task. In a series of posts on X, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company’s new image-generation tool’s popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. “We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” he wrote. OpeanAI intends to release its “first” open language model since GPT-2 “in the coming months.” The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia. OpenAI made a notable change to its content moderation policies after the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to create Studio Ghibli-style images. The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now “evolved” its approach, as stated in a blog post published by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI’s model behavior. OpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said. The latest update of the image generator on OpenAI’s ChatGPT has triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away.” The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images have sparked concerns about whether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization. OpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source. While the startup doesn’t expect to reach positive cash flow until 2029, it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2026 to surpass $29.4 billion, the report said. OpenAI on Tuesday rolled out a major upgrade to ChatGPT’s image-generation capabilities: ChatGPT can now use the GPT-4o model to generate and edit images and photos directly. The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI’s AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company’s Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company’s API service. The company’s CEO Sam Altman said on Wednesday, however, that the release of the image generation feature to free users would be delayed due to higher demand than the company expected. Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer, will lead the company’s global expansion and manage corporate partnerships as CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products, according to a blog post from OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer. OpenAI has updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company’s official media channels. The update enables real-time conversations, and the AI assistant is said to be more personable and interrupts users less often. Users on ChatGPT’s free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are “more direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative,” a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch. OpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country, per a report by The Information. One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI’s models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans. Noyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. “The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at Noyb, in a statement. “If it’s not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn’t enough. You can’t just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.” OpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less. OpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 “reasoning” AI model to deliver “consistently better responses.” It’s only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1. Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a post on X, that the company has trained a “new model” that’s “really good” at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming. And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all. we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.PROMPT:Please write a metafictional literary short story… OpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents — automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company’s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI’s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI’s Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI’s Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026. OpenAI intends to release several “agent” products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information. One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It’s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them. The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users. According to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI’s AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT’s weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model’s launch. OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In a post on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model.  A commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing. In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step “thought” process. ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model’s “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions. OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot’s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in. OpenAI announced a new AI “agent” called deep research that’s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources. OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user’s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models’ responses to human replies for that same post.  OpenAI launched a new AI “reasoning” model, o3-mini, the newest in the company’s o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.” A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT’s mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users. OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI’s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data. Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm. OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company’s AI “agent” tool, for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s. OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online. Operator, OpenAI’s agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website. OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email. ChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week. OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely. ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use. Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o. There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus. Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns. Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool. Most recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.  And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space. GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer. A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions. ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt. Yes. Due to the nature of how these models work, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel. We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry. Yes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users. It’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words. Yes, it was released March 1, 2023. Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc. Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc. It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used. Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet. Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives. OpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”. The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”. In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.” Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm. An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service. CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect. Several major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with. There have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes. Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day. Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they’re inconsistent at best. No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service. None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT. Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data. This story is continually updated with new information."
Waymo resumes service in San Francisco after robotaxis stall during blackout,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/21/waymo-suspends-service-in-san-francisco-as-robotaxis-stall-during-blackout/,"Waymo suspended its robotaxi service in San Francisco on Saturday evening after a massive blackout appeared to leave many of its vehicles stalled on city streets. Numerous photos and videos posted to social media captured Waymo robotaxis stalled on roads and at intersections as human drivers were either stuck behind them or weaved around them. Waymo said on Saturday that it had temporarily suspended service in the city due to the blackout. It wasn’t until late Sunday afternoon that a Waymo spokesperson told TechCrunch in a statement that the company was resuming service. “Yesterday’s power outage was a widespread event that caused gridlock across San Francisco, with non-functioning traffic signals and transit disruptions,” the spokesperson said. “While the failure of the utility infrastructure was significant, we are committed to ensuring our technology adjusts to traffic flow during such events.” The Waymo spokesperson added that the company is “focused on rapidly integrating the lessons learned from this event, and are committed to earning and maintaining the trust of the communities we serve every day.” Power outage took out the waymos RIP pic.twitter.com/DPte8oOGku The blackout also took down many of the city’s traffic lights and affected Muni mass transit, with San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie warning residents to stay off the roads unless they needed to travel. Waymo said that although its self-driving systems are designed to treat non-functioning traffic lights as four-way stops, the scale of Saturday’s blackout caused some robotaxis to remain stationary for longer than normal as they tried to assess the intersections. The company also said that the majority of active trips were completed successfully. The blackout appears to have been caused by a fire at a Pacific Gas & Electric substation in the city. SFGate reports that around 120,000 PG&E customers were affected by the blackout, and while the majority of them had power restored by late Saturday, 35,000 customers were still without power on Sunday morning. PG&E’s website also showed thousands of San Francisco customers still affected at that time. A letter from Tiger Global Management that leaked earlier this month said Waymo is now providing 450,000 robotaxi rides per week, nearly double the amount that the Alphabet-owned company disclosed in the spring. This post has been updated with Waymo’s statement that service is resuming. Power out in SF and the @Waymo’s are causing a MASSIVE jam in North Beach 🤣 pic.twitter.com/fuvhprlyma"
OpenAI allows users to directly adjust ChatGPT’s enthusiasm level,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/20/openai-allows-users-to-directly-adjust-chatgpts-warmth-and-enthusiasm/,"ChatGPT users can now tweak the chatbot’s warmth, enthusiasm, and emoji use, according to a social media post from OpenAI. These options (as well as similar adjustments to ChatGPT’s use of headers and lists) now appear in the Personalization menu and can be set to More, Less, or Default. They allow users to further customize ChatGPT’s tone, on top of the existing ability to set a “base style and tone” — including the Professional, Candid, and Quirky tones that OpenAI added in November. ChatGPT’s tone has been an ongoing issue this year, with OpenAI rolling back one update for being “too sycophant-y,” then later adjusting GPT-5 to be “warmer and friendlier” after some users complained that the new model was colder and less friendly. Some academics and AI critics have suggested that chatbots’ tendency to praise users and affirm their beliefs are a “dark pattern” that creates addictive behavior and can have a negative effect on users’ mental health. You can now adjust specific characteristics in ChatGPT, like warmth, enthusiasm, and emoji use.Now available in your ""Personalization"" settings. pic.twitter.com/7WSkOQVTKU"
New York governor Kathy Hochul signs RAISE Act to regulate AI safety,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/20/new-york-governor-kathy-hochul-signs-raise-act-to-regulate-ai-safety/,"Governor Kathy Hochul has signed the RAISE Act, positioning New York as the second U.S. state to enact major AI safety legislation. State lawmakers passed the RAISE Act in June, but following lobbying from the tech industry, Hochul proposed changes to scale the bill back. The New York Times reports that Hochul ultimately agreed to sign the original bill, while lawmakers agreed to make her requested changes next year. The bill will require large AI developers to publish information about their safety protocols and report safety incidents to the state within 72 hours. It will also create a new office within the Department of Financial Services to monitor AI development. If companies fail to submit safety reports or make false statements, they can be fined up to $1 million ($3 million for subsequent violations). California governor Gavin Newsom signed a similar safety bill in September, which Hochul referenced in her announcement. “This law builds on California’s recently adopted framework, creating a unified benchmark among the country’s leading tech states as the federal government lags behind, failing to implement common-sense regulations that protect the public,” Hochul said. New York state senator Andrew Gounardes, one of the bill’s sponsors, posted, “Big Tech thought they could weasel their way into killing our bill. We shut them down and passed the strongest AI safety law in the country.” Both OpenAI and Anthropic expressed support for New York’s bill while also calling for federal legislation, with Anthropic’s head of external affairs Sarah Heck telling the NYT, “The fact that two of the largest states in the country have now enacted AI transparency legislation signals the critical importance of safety and should inspire Congress to build on them.” Not everyone in the tech industry has been so supportive. In fact, a super PAC backed by Andreessen Horowitz and OpenAI president Greg Brockman is looking to challenge Assemblyman Alex Bores, who co-sponsored the bill with Gounardes. (Bores told journalists, “I appreciate how straightforward they’re being about it.”) This comes after President Donald Trump signed an executive order that directs federal agencies to challenge state AI laws. The order — backed by Trump’s AI czar David Sacks — is the latest attempt by the Trump administration to curtail states’ ability to regulate AI and will likely be challenged in court. We also discussed Trump’s executive order, and the role that Sacks and a16z have played in opposing state AI regulation, on the latest episode of the Equity podcast."
Ex-Splunk execs’ startup Resolve AI hits $1B valuation with Series A,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/ex-splunk-execs-startup-resolve-ai-hits-1-billion-valuation-with-series-a/,"Resolve AI, a startup developing an autonomous site reliability engineer (SRE), a tool that automatically maintains software systems, has raised a Series A led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, according to three people familiar with the deal. The headline valuation for the fresh round is $1 billion, sources said. However, the company’s actual blended valuation was lower because of a multi-tranched structure. In this setup, investors purchased some equity at a $1 billion valuation but acquired the remainder — likely a larger percentage of the round — at a lower price. This novel investment approach has recently become popular for the most sought-after AI startups, investors say. The startup’s annual recurring revenue (ARR) is approximately $4 million, two of the people said. The size of the funding round couldn’t be learned. Resolve AI and Lightspeed didn’t respond to our request for comment. Founded less than two years ago, the startup is led by former Splunk executive Spiros Xanthos and Mayank Agarwal, Splunk’s former chief architect for observability. The duo’s partnership dates back 20 years to their graduate studies at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. This isn’t their first collaboration; they previously co-founded Omnition, a startup that Splunk acquired in 2019. While human SREs are traditionally responsible for manually troubleshooting and resolving system failures, Resolve AI automates this process by autonomously identifying, diagnosing, and resolving production issues in real time. The automation addresses a growing challenge for companies. As software systems become more complex and distributed across cloud infrastructure, outfits often struggle to find and retain enough skilled SREs to keep systems running smoothly. Automating these tasks can reduce downtime, lower operational costs, and free up engineering teams to focus on building new features rather than trying to constantly stomp out production issues. Last October, Resolve AI raised a $35 million seed round led by Greylock with participation from World Labs founder Fei-Fei Li and Google DeepMind scientist Jeff Dean. Resolve AI competes with Traversal, an AI SRE startup that raised a $48 million Series A led by Kleiner Perkins, with participation from Sequoia.   "
Cursor continues acquisition spree with Graphite deal,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/cursor-continues-acquisition-spree-with-graphite-deal/,"AI coding assistant Cursor announced that it has acquired Graphite, a startup that uses AI to review and debug code. Although the terms of the deal were not disclosed, Axios reported that Cursor paid “way over” Graphite’s last valuation of $290 million, which was set when the five-year-old company raised a $52 million Series B earlier this year. The tie-up makes strategic sense. The output of code generated by AI is often buggy, forcing engineers to spend a lot of time on corrections. Even though Cursor offers AI-powered code review through its Bugbot product, Graphite’s specialized toolset provides a distinct capability called a “stacked pull request,” which enables developers to work on multiple dependent changes simultaneously without waiting for approvals. Combining AI-powered code writing with AI-powered code review tools speeds up the process from drafting code to shipping it. Other startups providing AI-powered code review include CodeRabbit, valued at $550 million in September, and a smaller competitor, Greptile, which announced a $25 million Series A this fall. Michael Truell, co-founder and CEO of Cursor, first met Graphite’s co-founders, Merrill Lutsky, Greg Foster, and Tomas Reimers, before launching the company as a Neo Scholar, a prestigious program for college students run by Neo, Ali Partovi’s early-stage venture firm. Neo backed Graphite at the seed stage, according to PitchBook data. Furthermore, both Cursor and Graphite have other investors in common, including Accel and Andreessen Horowitz. Cursor, which was last valued at $29 billion in November, has been on an acquisition spree. Last month, it purchased Growth by Design, a tech recruiting strategy company. In July, Cursor scooped up the talent from AI-powered CRM startup Koala for a post-money valuation of $129 million, according to PitchBook. "
"Yann LeCun confirms his new ‘world model’ startup, reportedly seeks $5B+ valuation",https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/yann-lecun-confirms-his-new-world-model-startup-reportedly-seeks-5b-valuation/,"Renowned AI scientist Yann LeCun confirmed on Thursday that he had launched a new startup — the worst-kept secret in the tech world — though he said he will not be running the new company as its CEO. His startup is called Advanced Machine Intelligence (AMI) and has hired Alex LeBrun, co-founder and CEO of medical transcription AI startup darling Nabla, as its CEO. Nabla disclosed LeBrun’s new job in a press release and LeCun confirmed it in a brief post on LinkedIn. “Yes, AMI Labs is my new startup. I’m the Executive Chairman. And Alex LeBrun is transitioning from CEO of Nabla to CEO of AMI Labs!” LeCun wrote. AMI Labs is also reportedly seeking to raise €500 million (about $586 million) at a €3 billion valuation (about $3.5 billion) right out of the gate, before even launching, the Financial Times reported, citing people familiar with the dealmaking. Given the kind of money that VCs are throwing at AI startups founded by world-recognized AI scientists these days, that’s not even an comparatively outrageous ask. For instance, former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati’s startup, Thinking Machines Lab, was valued at $12 billion for its seed round last year. And Murati doesn’t have the same kind of street cred as LeCun. LeCun, a professor at New York University who was formerly VP and Chief AI Scientist at Meta, won the prestigious A.M. Turing Award, for his work on reinforcement learning. The press release also confirms what everyone knew as well: that AMI Labs is working on world model AI. This is an alternative to LLMs where the AI attempts to understand its environment (aka the world) so it can simulate cause-and-effect and what-if scenarios to predict outcomes. World model creators believe it’s the answer to LLMs’ structural hallucination problems. LLMs can’t be trusted to never fabricate info because it is their very nature to be “non-deterministic” — that is, creative. Top labs and startups like Google DeepMind and Fei-Fei Li’s startup, World Labs, are also developing world models. By that comparison, the fundraising aspirations of AMI might appear a bit more audacious. When World Labs debuted, Li raised $230 million at a $1 billion valuation right out of the gate, which was considered a lot at the time. But that was way back in August 2024, or about 100 AI years ago. Meanwhile, Nabla says the company will be searching for a new CEO and will be, for now, run by its co-founder and COO, Delphine Groll, who has not been handed the reins permanently yet. Nabla also says it has signed a partnership to use AMI’s models as they are developed. Nabla has raised $120 million in total from an all-star list of backers, including a $70 million Series C in June. LeCun is one of Nabla’s investors, as is Tony Fadell’s Build Collective, HV Capital, Highland Europe, and Cathay Innovation. Nabla’s LeBrun could be a good choice for CEO. He’s been building multimodal AI since before anyone called it that, working at Nuance Communications in the early 2010s, which originally powered Apple’s Siri in those long-ago years when Siri was wow technology. (Microsoft eventually acquired Nuance.) He founded and sold a couple of natural language startups, including one to Facebook. Then he ran Facebook’s AI division before founding Nabla in 2018, according to his LinkedIn. LeBrun said that Nabla, a darling of the Paris-based AI startup community, is still growing well. “We have more than tripled our live ARR this year. Up next to $1B!” LeBrun wrote as he announced his departure as CEO. The founder says he will remain on at Nabla as chairman and chief AI scientist. Nabla declined further comment and AMI did not immediately respond to our request for comment. "

OpenAI adds new teen safety rules to ChatGPT as lawmakers weigh AI standards for minors,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/openai-adds-new-teen-safety-rules-to-models-as-lawmakers-weigh-ai-standards-for-minors/,"In its latest effort to address growing concerns about AI’s impact on young people, OpenAI on Thursday updated its guidelines for how its AI models should behave with users under 18, and published new AI literacy resources for teens and parents. Still, questions remain about how consistently such policies will translate into practice.  The updates come as the AI industry generally, and OpenAI in particular, faces increased scrutiny from policymakers, educators, and child-safety advocates after several teenagers allegedly died by suicide after prolonged conversations with AI chatbots.  Gen Z, which includes those born between 1997 and 2012, are the most active users of OpenAI’s chatbot. And following OpenAI’s recent deal with Disney, more young people may flock to the platform, which lets you do everything from ask for help with homework to generate images and videos on thousands of topics. Last week, 42 state attorneys general signed a letter to Big Tech companies, urging them to implement safeguards on AI chatbots to protect children and vulnerable people. And as the Trump administration works out what the federal standard on AI regulation might look like, policymakers like Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) have introduced legislation that would ban minors from interacting with AI chatbots altogether.  OpenAI’s updated Model Spec, which lays out behavior guidelines for its large language models, builds on existing specifications that prohibit the models from generating sexual content involving minors, or encouraging self-harm, delusions, or mania. This would work together with an upcoming age-prediction model that would identify when an account belongs to a minor and automatically roll out teen safeguards.  Compared with adult users, the models are subject to stricter rules when a teenager is using them. Models are instructed to avoid immersive romantic roleplay, first-person intimacy, and first-person sexual or violent roleplay, even when it’s non-graphic. The specification also calls for extra caution around subjects like body image and disordered eating behaviors, and instructs the models to prioritize communicating about safety over autonomy when harm is involved and avoid advice that would help teens conceal unsafe behavior from caregivers.  OpenAI specifies that these limits should hold even when prompts are framed as “fictional, hypothetical, historical, or educational” — common tactics that rely on role-play or edge-case scenarios in order to get an AI model to deviate from its guidelines.  OpenAI says the key safety practices for teens are underpinned by four principles that guide the models’ approach:  The document also shares several examples of the chatbot explaining why it can’t “roleplay as your girlfriend” or “help with extreme appearance changes or risky shortcuts.”  Lily Li, a privacy and AI lawyer and founder of Metaverse Law, said it was encouraging to see OpenAI take steps to have its chatbot decline to engage in such behavior.  Explaining that one of the biggest complaints advocates and parents have about chatbots is that they relentlessly promote ongoing engagement in a way that can be addictive for teens, she said: “I am very happy to see OpenAI say, in some of these responses, we can’t answer your question. The more we see that, I think that would break the cycle that would lead to a lot of inappropriate conduct or self-harm.” That said, examples are just that: cherry-picked instances of how OpenAI’s safety team would like the models to behave. Sycophancy, or an AI chatbot’s tendency to be overly agreeable with the user, has been listed as a prohibited behavior in previous versions of the Model Spec, but ChatGPT still engaged in that behavior anyway. That was particularly true with GPT-4o, a model that has been associated with several instances of what experts are calling “AI psychosis.” Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting kids in the digital world, raised concerns about potential conflicts within the Model Spec’s under-18 guidelines. He highlighted tensions between safety-focused provisions and the “no topic is off limits” principle, which directs models to address any topic regardless of sensitivity.  “We have to understand how the different parts of the spec fit together,” he said, noting that certain sections may push systems toward engagement over safety. His organization’s testing revealed that ChatGPT often mirrors users’ energy, sometimes resulting in responses that aren’t contextually appropriate or aligned with user safety, he said. In the case of Adam Raine, a teenager who died by suicide after months of dialogue with ChatGPT, the chatbot engaged in such mirroring, their conversations show. That case also brought to light how OpenAI’s moderation API failed to prevent unsafe and harmful interactions despite flagging more than 1,000 instances of ChatGPT mentioning suicide and 377 messages containing self-harm content. But that wasn’t enough to stop Adam from continuing his conversations with ChatGPT.  In an interview with TechCrunch in September, former OpenAI safety researcher Steven Adler said this was because, historically, OpenAI had run classifiers (the automated systems that label and flag content) in bulk after the fact, not in real time, so they didn’t properly gate the user’s interaction with ChatGPT.  OpenAI now uses automated classifiers to assess text, image, and audio content in real time, according to the firm’s updated parental controls document. The systems are designed to detect and block content related to child sexual abuse material, filter sensitive topics, and identify self-harm. If the system flags a prompt that suggests a serious safety concern, a small team of trained people will review the flagged content to determine if there are signs of “acute distress,” and may notify a parent. Torney applauded OpenAI’s recent steps toward safety, including its transparency in publishing guidelines for users under 18 years old.  “Not all companies are publishing their policy guidelines in the same way,” Torney said, pointing to Meta’s leaked guidelines, which showed that the firm let its chatbots engage in sensual and romantic conversations with children. “This is an example of the type of transparency that can support safety researchers and the general public in understanding how these models actually function and how they’re supposed to function.” Ultimately, though, it is the actual behavior of an AI system that matters, Adler told TechCrunch on Thursday.  “I appreciate OpenAI being thoughtful about intended behavior, but unless the company measures the actual behaviors, intentions are ultimately just words,” he said. Put differently: What’s missing from this announcement is evidence that ChatGPT actually follows the guidelines set out in the Model Spec.  Experts say with these guidelines, OpenAI appears poised to get ahead of certain legislation, like California’s SB 243, a recently signed bill regulating AI companion chatbots that goes into effect in 2027.  The Model Spec’s new language language mirrors some of the law’s main requirements around prohibiting chatbots from engaging in conversations around suicidal ideation, self-harm, or sexually explicit content. The bill also requires platforms to provide alerts every three hours to minors reminding them they are speaking to a chatbot, not a real person, and they should take a break.  When asked how often ChatGPT would remind teens that they’re talking to a chatbot and ask them to take a break, an OpenAI spokesperson did not share details, saying only that the company trains its models to represent themselves as AI and remind users of that, and that it implements break reminders during “long sessions.” The company also shared two new AI literacy resources for parents and families. The tips include conversation starters and guidance to help parents talk to teens about what AI can and can’t do, build critical thinking, set healthy boundaries, and navigate sensitive topics.  Taken together, the documents formalize an approach that shares responsibility with caretakers: OpenAI spells out what the models should do, and offers families a framework for supervising how it’s used.  The focus on parental responsibility is notable because it mirrors Silicon Valley talking points. In its recommendations for federal AI regulation posted this week, VC firm Andreessen Horowitz suggested more disclosure requirements for child safety, rather than restrictive requirements, and weighted the onus more toward parental responsibility. Several of OpenAI’s principles — safety-first when values conflict; nudging users toward real-world support; reinforcing that the chatbot isn’t a person — are being articulated as teen guardrails. But several adults have died by suicide and suffered life-threatening delusions, which invites an obvious follow-up: Should those defaults apply across the board, or does OpenAI see them as trade-offs it’s only willing to enforce when minors are involved? An OpenAI spokesperson countered that the firm’s safety approach is designed to protect all users, saying the Model Spec is just one component of a multi-layered strategy.   Li says it has been a “bit of a wild west” so far regarding the legal requirements and tech companies’ intentions. But she feels laws like SB 243, which requires tech companies to disclose their safeguards publicly, will change the paradigm.  “The legal risks will show up now for companies if they advertise that they have these safeguards and mechanisms in place on their website, but then don’t follow through with incorporating these safeguards,” Li said. “Because then, from a plaintiff’s point of view, you’re not just looking at the standard litigation or legal complaints; you’re also looking at potential unfair, deceptive advertising complaints.” "
Known uses voice AI to help you go on more in-person dates,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/known-uses-voice-ai-to-help-you-go-on-more-in-person-dates/,"Celeste Amadon and Asher Allen were working on an app that used AI to book restaurants for dates when they stumbled on a bigger idea that encourages people to meet in person. And now it’s catching on with investors. The duo created a voice-powered AI onboarding system for their app that helped them learn more about users without them having to fill out a form. What they discovered: People loved to talk, and that increased the length of the onboarding session with the app clocking 26 minutes on average. That is how San Francisco-based dating startup Known was born.  “Our take is that for the first time, we could know enough about somebody to serve them a date that would make sense. And if we could do that much faster with less rejection rate, we could create a user experience that could get people out on more dates,” she said. And early results suggested they were on to something.  In its test phase in San Francisco, Known said it observed 80% of its introductions led to in-person dates, which is much higher than swipe-based dating apps. Buoyed by these signals, the startup has raised $9.7 million from investors, including Forerunner and NFX, along with Pear VC and Coelius Capital. Notably, this is the first dating app investment for Forerunner. “Celeste is a really thoughtful founder who understands the mindset of the consumer, which is a young female, to be honest. There are other people who can be focused on the male demographic, but she is focused on the young female who has a lot of unspoken desires and needs that, if you put them in a profile, they would never say, this versus that. And I think in a conversation, you can get a lot of those nuances out, but in the past, the conversation required a $10,000 matchmaker,” Eurie Kim, a partner at Forerunner, told TechCrunch. Amadon said she has always been very interested in social impact at scale and thinks dating is inherently one of the biggest problems facing her generation.  “There’ve been a million pieces written about the loneliness epidemic in the U.S. And I do really think that it’s our generation’s largest problem,” said Amadon, who, along with Allen, dropped out of Stanford to build the startup.  The app, which is being testedin San Francisco in beta, uses voice AI-powered onboarding to ask several questions to users without having them fill out any forms. Amadon said because of this modality, the startup is able to know more about users and provide them with great matches, with one user’s onboarding clocking in at an hour and 38 minutes.  According to Known, when people typed their responses out, they would edit them. With voice, the onboarding is more personable. The company’s AI can ask dynamic follow-ups based on the conversation. For instance, if someone has newly moved to the city, the AI can ask them what they like and dislike about their experience thus far. Once the onboarding is complete, the AI suggests potential matches to users. They can ask AI agents about those profiles. If they like a profile, they can tap on “interested.” When two people are matched, they have 24 hours to accept the introduction and 24 hours to agree to a date. The company said that with this mechanism, the app aims to avoid lingering chats and ghosting while encouraging people to meet in real life. After their dates, users can provide their feedback to the AI and get more refined recommendations for matches. Known hasn’t completely ditched the restaurant idea. The app also helps in picking restaurants based on user likes and dislikes. Using the AI chat and calendar integrations, users can also indicate their availability for the first dates. In the beta phase, the company charged $30 per successful date. However, the startup is not set on the price and said it will experiment with different models to find out what payment modality works the best. Today the startup has three full-time engineers and four people working on go-to-market, with several contractors working in all areas. Amadon, whose previous experience includes internships in politics, and Allen, who worked on product at the AI-powered online shopping app Phia, plan to bolster headcount with this funding.  Known is currently testing in San Francisco and plans to launch early next year. There are several other new startups, including Overtone, Hinge CEO Justin McLeod’s new app, that are trying to use AI to know more about users and try to find matches for them. Some of them claim to bring bespoke services of matchmakers that cost thousands of dollars at a fraction of the cost. Incumbents like Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge are also pushing AI features to keep their user base engaged. Despite the growing number of startups, Amadon welcomes the competition. “When it comes to other startup dating products, I’ve been so happy to see a lot of people building in the space because I think it shows that it’s time to shift away from a swipe-based model. And I think most of them that I’ve seen have been pretty different from what we’re building at Known,” she said."
"Meta is developing a new image and video model for a 2026 release, report says",https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/meta-is-developing-a-new-image-and-video-model-for-a-2026-release-report-says/,"It’s all hands on deck at Meta, as the company develops new AI models under its superintelligence lab led by Scale AI co-founder, Alexandr Wang. The company is now working on an image and video model codenamed “Mango” along with a new text-based model internally known as “Avocado,” The Wall Street Journal reported. The tech giant plans to release the new models in the first half of 2026, the publication said, citing an internal Q&A at Meta on Thursday, where Wang and chief product officer Chris Cox unveiled the new roadmap. Wang had said Meta aims to make the text-based model better at coding while also exploring new world models that understand visual information and can reason, plan, and act without needing to be trained on every possibility. Meta has more recently fallen behind its rivals, like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google, in the AI race. The company’s AI division saw significant restructurings this year, which included leadership changes and the poaching of researchers from other top companies. However, several of the researchers who joined Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL) have already left the company. Last month, the company’s chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, also announced that he’s leaving to create his own startup. Meta doesn’t have a winning AI product as of yet. Instead, Meta AI assistant’s numbers are buoyed by the company’s existing social networks spanning billions of users, since the company places the assistant in the search bar of its apps. This means the first projects and models coming out of MSL will have a lot riding on them."
OpenAI is reportedly trying to raise $100B at an $830B valuation,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/openai-is-reportedly-trying-to-raise-100b-at-an-830b-valuation/,"OpenAI is in talks to raise up to $100 billion in a funding round that could value the ChatGPT maker at up to $830 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing anonymous sources. The company is aiming to raise the funding by the end of the calendar first quarter next year, and it may ask sovereign wealth funds to invest in the round, the WSJ reported. The Information first reported news of the deal, though it said the fundraise would land OpenAI a $750 billion price tag. The funding would come as OpenAI commits to spend trillions of dollars and strikes deals around the world as the company tries to stay ahead in the race to develop AI technology. The cash injection would also help the company with its spending on inferencing, which seems to be funded more by cash than cloud credits, suggesting the company’s compute costs have grown beyond what partnerships and credits can subsidize. And, as competition intensifies from rivals like Anthropic and Google, OpenAI has had to step on the gas to release new models and expand its presence in the developer and tooling ecosystem. Meanwhile, broader sentiment around AI has recently cooled as investors start doubting whether the pace of debt-fueled investment by giants like Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle, and OpenAI itself can be maintained in the long run. It also doesn’t help that the production of chips is being constrained by shortages in the supply of memory chips, which threatens to affect the broader tech sector. OpenAI has also been rumored to be working on an IPO as a way to raise tens of billions and fund its development efforts, which are currently said to be generating annual run-rate revenue of about $20 billion. There are also rumors that the company is courting Amazon for a $10 billion investment that would also give the AI lab access to the tech giant’s new AI computing chips. If the fundraise happens, it would add a substantial amount to OpenAI’s coffers, which currently have more than $64 billion, according to PitchBook data. The company was most recently valued at about $500 billion in a secondary transaction. OpenAI did not immediately return a request for comment.  "

"ChatGPT launches an app store, lets developers know it’s open for business",https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/chatgpt-launches-an-app-store-lets-developers-know-its-open-for-business/,"App developers looking to launch their programs in ChatGPT can now submit them for review and potential publication, OpenAI said Wednesday. The company also introduced a new app directory within Chat’s tools menu that has swiftly been dubbed an “app store.”  In October, the company announced the arrival of apps in its chatbot, explaining that the move would bring a broader suite of capabilities to ChatGPT users. Major platforms — including Expedia, Spotify, Zillow, and Canva — announced integrations that would allow users to access their services directly from Chat conversations. Now, the company is opening up the field to a broader array of players. “Apps extend ChatGPT conversations by bringing in new context and letting users take actions like order groceries, turn an outline into a slide deck, or search for an apartment,” the company said Wednesday. OpenAI’s Apps SDK, which is still in beta, currently provides a toolkit for developers looking to create new experiences for ChatGPT users. Once developers are ready, they can submit their apps to the company’s OpenAI Developer platform, where they will be able to track its approval status, the company said. A number of approved apps will start launching within Chat in the coming year, it added.  This is a big step for OpenAI toward expanding the app ecosystem within Chat and, at the same time, giving users more reasons to use the app and stay on it. "
Pickle Robot adds Tesla veteran as first CFO,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/pickle-robot-adds-tesla-veteran-as-first-cfo/,"Pickle Robot, which builds autonomous unloading robots for warehouses and distribution centers, announced a new chief financial officer just days after a report of a major deal with UPS. The Charlestown, Massachusetts-based company announced that it hired Jeff Evanson as its CFO on Thursday. Evanson had been consulting for the company since September and recently joined full time. Evanson previously served as the vice president of global investor relations and strategy at Tesla from 2011 to 2017. In that role, he worked directly with Elon Musk and helped the company raise debt and equity financing to support the launch of multiple Tesla vehicle lines and company acquisitions. Evanson will be Pickle’s first CFO and joins as the company — founded in 2018 with around $100 million in venture capital raised — reportedly expands its partnership with shipping giant UPS. According to Bloomberg, UPS is investing $120 million to purchase 400 of Pickle’s robots, with deployment beginning in late 2026 and early 2027. Pickle declined to comment on this week’s UPS news. A Pickle spokesperson did confirm that UPS has been a Pickle customer for a few years but wouldn’t confirm when the partnership started."
Why British politicians are flocking to American tech giants,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/why-british-politicians-are-flocking-to-american-tech-giants/,"The AI talent wars show no signs of slowing, with companies making headlines weekly for their latest high-profile hires. This includes engineers they are poaching from each other or acqui-hiring but also, increasingly, senior executives that can support them as they scale up. Less than 10 days after Slack CEO Denise Dresser became OpenAI’s chief revenue officer, former British finance minister George Osborne announced he was joining Sam Altman’s company. Shortly thereafter, the crypto exchange Coinbase separately appointed Osborne to lead its internal advisory council. The announcements drew particular attention in the U.K., where commenters noted that Osborne joins a growing list of former British politicians now working for major U.S. tech companies. If you’re not familiar with him or this trend, here’s what you need to know. A former conservative Member of Parliament, George Osborne served as chancellor of the Exchequer from 2010 to 2016 — a role equivalent to that of a finance minister or treasury secretary in other countries, and currently held by Rachel Reeves. After Prime Minister David Cameron resigned following the 2016 Brexit vote, Osborne eventually left public office in 2017. Alongside multiple other engagements, including a part-time advisory role for the investment firm BlackRock, he served as editor of the Evening Standard from 2017 to 2020. During that period, he also co-founded a VC firm, 9yards Capital, with his brother Theo and Theo’s brother-in-law David Fisher as co-founders and managing partners. Several companies in 9yards’ portfolio have gone public since then — including Robinhood, Toast, and Coinbase.  Osborne announced on X that he was joining OpenAI “as managing director and head of OpenAI for [C]ountries, based here in London.” He will help expand existing partnerships and build new ones, OpenAI chief global affairs officer Chris Lehane wrote on LinkedIn. Introduced in May 2025, OpenAI for Countries is an initiative through which the AI company partners with governments looking to build in-country data center capacity and localize ChatGPT for their language and culture. OpenAI for Countries is an extension of the Stargate project, a $500 billion initiative through which OpenAI is currently building five new data centers across the U.S. with Oracle and SoftBank. But beyond infrastructure, its stated goal is to “support countries around the world that would prefer to build on democratic AI rails.” As OpenAI turns 10, it is only natural that it starts hiring the kind of talent that won’t get turned down at the Ritz for wearing sport shoes. An Oxford graduate and the son of a baronet, Osborne fits the bill — but his network and reach are even more valuable, and his podcast with former Labour shadow chancellor Ed Balls, called “Political Currency,” underscores his extensive political connections. His track record and contacts could be even more directly relevant for Coinbase, which he was already advising and where he will now “play a much more active role in helping us with policymakers around the world,” the company’s chief policy officer Faryar Shirzad told Reuters. Staying on the right side of regulators is particularly important for crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, which has been making efforts to influence governments in the U.S. and beyond. But this is also critical for OpenAI, which intends to weigh in as AI gains a foothold in governments’ agendas. According to Lehane’s LinkedIn post, Osborne’s decision to take the role “reflects a shared belief that AI is becoming critical infrastructure — and early decisions about how it’s built, governed, and deployed will shape economics and geopolitics for years to come.” Osborne’s latest role immediately drew parallels with other high-profile British politicians who went on to join major U.S. tech companies.  These include former U.K. deputy Prime Minister and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, who served as Meta’s policy chief for over six years, and, more recently, former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak taking on advisory roles with Microsoft and AI firm Anthropic. This trend raises different concerns depending on your perspective. Some critics worry about active Members of Parliament like Sunak potentially advocating for U.S. corporate interests while still serving in government. Others take issue with former officials like Osborne leveraging their government experience and connections to secure highly lucrative private sector positions. The “revolving door” phenomenon between government and the private sector isn’t new. But the practice has attracted heightened scrutiny in Europe, especially when controversial foreign companies — whether tech firms or retailers like Shein — hire former government officials to help navigate regulations and influence policy. Seen from the other side, this is simply a matter of leveraging skills and experience. In his bio on 9yards’ team page, the VC firm touts that “George devised many regulations that positioned the U.K. as a global fintech leader, including the open banking regime and the FCA ‘sandbox.’” Others, however, view Osborne’s career moves more critically. They point to his controversial austerity policies as chancellor, and note that he has a history of ethics concerns around the revolving door. For example, when he took the Evening Standard editor job in 2017, he failed to seek approval from the government’s ethics watchdog first — a move that led to the body being criticized as “toothless.” His attitude at the time was telling: “At the age of 45, I don’t want to spend the rest of my life just being an ex-chancellor,” Osborne declared. Either way, that mindset — transitioning quickly from public service to high-paying private roles — is precisely what makes his OpenAI and Coinbase appointments part of a broader pattern that concerns ethics watchdogs today."
ChatGPT’s mobile app hits new milestone of $3B in consumer spending,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/chatgpts-mobile-app-hits-new-milestone-of-3b-in-consumer-spending/,"ChatGPT has hit a new milestone of $3 billion in worldwide consumer spending on mobile as of this week, according to estimates from app intelligence provider Appfigures. This figure represents the total spending on iOS and Android devices since the app’s launch in May 2023, when it first arrived, then only on iOS. What’s notable is that the bulk of that spending took place this year. Worldwide, consumers spent an estimated $2.48 billion in the ChatGPT mobile app in 2025, representing a 408% year-over-year increase from the $487 million spent in 2024. In 2023, the app’s first year of availability, it earned $42.9 million, before growing 1,036% to reach the 2024 figure. These numbers represent a sharp rise in consumer adoption, compared with other popular apps. For instance, it took ChatGPT 31 months to reach $3 billion in consumer spending, but the top earner, TikTok, took 58 months to do so, Appfigures told TechCrunch. ChatGPT also reached the milestone faster than top streaming apps like Disney+ and HBO Max, which hit the $3 billion figure in 42 months and 46 months, respectively. xAI’s Grok, however, is seeing a similar revenue trajectory to ChatGPT, compared with other AI rivals. Grok was released in late 2023 to X Premium Plus subscribers before becoming more broadly available last year. But if you compare the pace of consumer spending across AI apps, Grok came the closest to matching ChatGPT’s cumulative revenue at the same point, once it began monetizing. (You can see this on the chart below, which plots the AI apps’ spending aligned to when each app began monetizing.) While the $3 billion in spending represents a significant uptake by consumers, it’s not the only way to measure AI app adoption or potential long-term revenue. ChatGPT’s mobile customers are buying paid subscriptions, like the $20 per month ChatGPT Plus or the $200 per month ChatGPT Pro for advanced users. But AI apps can generate revenue in other ways, including through developer offerings and, perhaps soon for ChatGPT, ads. In addition, ChatGPT on Wednesday launched its own app store of sorts, which the company suggests will be monetized in some way in the future, its blog post noted. Google, meanwhile, is exploring the potential to transition its healthy search ads business to AI-powered search, placing ads in AI Mode, AI Overviews, AI shopping, and an increasingly AI-powered Discover page, among other things. Anthropic is aiming at the business market and is reportedly on track for $70 billion in revenue by 2028. "
Peripheral Labs taps into self-driving car sensors to bring sports fans right into the game,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/peripheral-labs-taps-into-self-driving-car-sensors-to-bring-sports-fans-right-into-the-game/,"Multiple reports suggest that live sports viewing has declined for certain sports, especially among Gen Z. To solve this, leagues and broadcasters are trying to make sports more engaging for fans with different kinds of viewing experiences, stats, and analysis. One way to do this is using volumetric video generation that lets users view the play from various angles, giving an inside-the-video-game experience. The core technology uses numerous cameras to capture the footage in 3D for everyone to look at it from various viewpoints. Canada-based Peripheral Labs wants to make this technology affordable for leagues and teams so it can reach more broadcasters and fans. Peripheral Labs was founded by Kelvin Cui and Mustafa Khan in 2024. Both have worked on driverless cars for the University of Toronto’s team, winning several trophies. Khan has worked as a researcher at Huawei, and Cui has experience working on chassis systems as a software engineer at Tesla. “Both Mustafa and I are huge sports fans. He has been a massive Arsenal fan, and I grew up watching the Vancouver Canucks since I was seven. When Mustafa showed me his research about 3D reconstruction, my brain said it would be cool to watch hockey like this [in a free-flowing, multi-angle way]. This is how we started on Peripheral Labs,” Cui said in a call with TechCrunch. The company said the idea of volumetric generation isn’t new. But with the new AI models and advances in computer vision, its founders are confident the technology is ready for the masses. The duo is using their experience with self-driving cars to apply concepts of robotics perception and 3D vision for the 3D reconstruction of video in sports. This system can reduce the camera requirement from over 100 to as few as 32, helping decrease cost and operational overhead, according to Cui and Khan. The startup aims to keep the hardware cost as minimal as possible for teams and broadcasters and sign multi-year contracts for its platform. The software platform will bring biomechanical data of players and stats for teams and leagues using its own sensor stack, which is similar to the sensors on self-driving cars that capture the scene with depth. It will enable new ways to control the viewing of the play for broadcasters and fans using photorealistic 3D reconstruction technology. For instance, if fans wanted to track only the player with the ball, they could do that. They can also freeze a moment in-game to see different angles for a foul or a critical moment in play. “While we work with off-the-shelf cameras, the way we package it with our experience in robotics and ML is what gives us an edge both in terms of platforms and also scaling from small practice enclosures to big soccer and football stadiums,” Cui said. On the software side, the platform said it can observe different joints, including finger movements of players, to measure flexion. For instance, in the video above of two people playing football (soccer), the system measures flexion of knees and ankles. This could give coaches more ideas about body positioning and the flexibility of a player, and help them improve. The startup has raised a $3.6 million seed round led by Khosla Ventures, with participation from Daybreak Capital, Entrepreneurs First, and Transpose Platform. Joe Ros, a partner at Entrepreneurs First, noted the fund was surprised by how big a following the founders and their autonomous driving team have at the University of Toronto. He noted investors are often hesitant to invest in sports-related startups, but Peripheral Labs is also an entertainment play. “Their ultimate viewer is the consumer, and their demand for sports content is evergreen, not cyclical. With Peripheral, the new standard for that consumption will be immersive, volumetric video. And the work they’re doing now in sports will give them the data, tech, and deployment moat to be the only person in the market able to enable this,” he told TechCrunch over email. Peripheral Labs said the startup was selective about the VCs they were bringing in, who could help in different areas like product development and go-to-market advice. The company has 10 engineers on its staff and aims to increase headcount with a focus on platform and hardware development to reduce costs for the company, decrease the latency of the system, and also increase the resolution of 3D reconstruction. The startup hasn’t made any public announcements about the partners it is working with, but said it is in conversation with several teams and leagues in North America. The company competes with other startups like Arcturus Studios in the volumetric capture for sports. "
Luma releases a new AI model that lets users generate a video from a start  and end frame,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/luma-releases-a-new-ai-model-that-lets-users-generate-a-video-from-a-start-and-end-frame/,"Luma, the a16z-backed AI video and 3D model company, released a new model called Ray3 Modify that allows users to modify existing footage by providing character reference images that preserve the performance of the original footage. Users can also provide a start and an end frame to guide the model to generate transitional footage. The company said Thursday the Ray3 Modify model solves the problems of preserving human performance while editing or generating effects using AI for creative studios. The startup said the model follows the input footage better, allowing studios to use human actors for creative or brand footage. Luma mentioned the new model retains the actor’s original motion, timing, eye line, and emotional delivery while transforming the scene. With Ray3 Modify, users can provide a character reference for transformation to the original footage and convert the human actor’s appearance into that character. This reference also allows creators to retain information like costumes, likeness, and identity across the shoot. What’s more, users can also provide start and end reference frames to create a video using the new Ray3 Modify model. This is helpful for creators in directing transitions or controlling character movements or behavior while maintaining continuity between scenes. “Generative video models are incredibly expressive but also hard to control. Today, we are excited to introduce Ray3 Modify that blends the real-world with the expressivity of AI while giving full control to creatives. This means creative teams can capture performances with a camera and then immediately modify them to be in any location imaginable, change costumes, or even go back and reshoot the scene with AI, without recreating the physical shoot,” Amit Jain, co-founder and CEO of Luma AI, said in a statement. Luma said the new model is available to users through the company’s Dream Machine platform. The company, which competes with the likes of Runway and Kling, released video modification capabilities in June 2025. The model release comes on the back of a fresh $900 million funding round, led by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund-owned AI company Humain, for the startup announced in November. Existing investors like a16z, Amplify Partners, and Matrix Partners also participated in the round. The startup is also planning to build a 2GW AI cluster in Saudi Arabia along with Humain. "
Vibe-coding startup Lovable raises $330M at a $6.6B valuation,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/vibe-coding-startup-lovable-raises-330m-at-a-6-6b-valuation/,"Swedish vibe-coding startup Lovable has more than tripled its valuation in just five months. Stockholm-based Lovable on Thursday said it had raised $330 million in a Series B funding round that was led by CapitalG and Menlo Ventures, at a $6.6 billion valuation. Khosla Ventures, Salesforce Ventures, and Databricks Ventures also participated, as did other investors. This raise comes mere months after Lovable raised a $200 million Series A round that valued the company at $1.8 billion in July. One of the quickest to capitalize on the AI boom, Lovable has built a “vibe-coding” tool that lets people use text prompts to write code and build complete apps. The company launched in 2024, and has grown blazing fast: It reached the vaunted $100 million ARR milestone within eight months, and just four months later, doubled that to surpass $200 million in annual recurring revenue. The company counts major software names like Klarna, Uber, and Zendesk as customers, and claims that more than 100,000 new projects are built on its platform every day, and more than 25 million projects were created in its first year. Lovable said it would use the new funding for building deeper integrations with third-party apps, expanding its features for enterprise use-cases, and to flesh out its platform with the infrastructure needed — like databases, payments, and hosting — to build full-fledged applications and services. Lovable co-founder and CEO Anton Osika said onstage at this year’s Slush conference in Helsinki, Finland that he credits the company’s ability to scale to his decision to ignore calls from investors to relocate the company to Silicon Valley. “It was tempting, but I really resisted that,” Osika said onstage at the November conference. “I [can] sit here now and say, ‘Look, guys, you can build a global AI company from this country.’ There is more available talent if you have a strong mission, and you have a lot of urgency coming together as a group and working.” In November, the company was called out for not paying VAT, a tax that applies to most goods and services in the European Union (EU). Osika confirmed that this was true in a LinkedIn post, saying that the company would remedy the situation, and shut down comments saying taxes like this are why the EU isn’t a good home for high-growth startups. Vibe coding continues to be a hot area of investing for VCs. Cursor, another vibe-coding darling, raised $2.3 billion in November at a $29.3 billion valuation. Like Lovable, this was also the company’s second funding round of the year, seeing its valuation double between June and November. TechCrunch reached out to Lovable for any additional information. "
Amazon’s new Alexa+ feature adds conversational AI to Ring doorbells,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/amazons-new-alexa-feature-adds-conversational-ai-to-ring-doorbells/,"Amazon is adding a new feature to Alexa+ that adds a conversational AI to Ring doorbells, letting users manage deliveries, turn down sales folks, and let family or friends leave a message when they are not around. Called Greetings, the feature helps Ring determine who is visiting your house based on their apparel, actions, and what they are holding, and responds accordingly. For example, if the system sees a person in a delivery uniform dropping off a package, it will respond based on your instructions. The feature adds settings that let you specify where delivery people can leave packages, and direct them toward water or snacks you might have kept out. If a delivery person needs a signature, Alexa can also ask them when they might return, and pass that message to the user. It can also handle sales reps or service vendors. You can set an instruction such as “If someone comes to the door trying to sell something, politely let them know we’re not interested.”  And if you’re busy or not home, Alexa can greet friends or family when they visit, and ask them to leave a message for you. It goes without saying that the tech presents the risk of misidentifying people and responding inappropriately — if, for example, a friend works in logistics and comes to see you after work in their delivery uniform, Ring may, via Alexa, ask them to leave a package somewhere instead of letting them leave a message. The new feature follows a controversial facial recognition feature for Ring called “Familiar Faces” that lets you create a catalog of the faces of up to 50 people who visit you regularly. Once labeled, these people will be named in the Ring app’s timeline and notifications when they visit. Amazon says Greetings uses Ring’s video descriptions to determine who the main subject in front of the camera is for generating responses, and it doesn’t identify who the person is. The feature is compatible with Ring Wired Doorbell Pro (3rd Gen) and Ring Wired Doorbell Plus (2nd Gen) and is available to users on the Ring Premium Plan who have enabled video descriptions. It is rolling out to Alexa+ Early access customers in the U.S. and Canada."
"Adobe hit with proposed class-action, accused of misusing authors’ work in AI training",https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/adobe-hit-with-proposed-class-action-accused-of-misusing-authors-work-in-ai-training/,"Like pretty much every other tech company in existence, Adobe has leaned heavily into AI over the past several years. The software firm has launched a number of different AI services since 2023, including Firefly — its AI-powered media-generation suite. Now, however, the company’s full-throated embrace of the technology may have led to trouble, as a new lawsuit claims it used pirated books to train one of its AI models. A proposed class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of Elizabeth Lyon, an author from Oregon, claims that Adobe used pirated versions of numerous books — including her own — to train the company’s SlimLM program. Adobe describes SlimLM as a small language model series that can be “optimized for document assistance tasks on mobile devices.” It states that SlimLM was pre-trained on SlimPajama-627B, a “deduplicated, multi-corpora, open-source dataset” released by Cerebras in June of 2023. Lyon, who has written a number of guidebooks for non-fiction writing, says that some of her works were included in a pretraining dataset that Adobe had used. Lyon’s lawsuit, which was originally reported on by Reuters, says that her writing was included in a processed subset of a manipulated dataset that was the basis of Adobe’s program: “The SlimPajama dataset was created by copying and manipulating the RedPajama dataset (including copying Books3),” the lawsuit says. “Thus, because it is a derivative copy of the RedPajama dataset, SlimPajama contains the Books3 dataset, including the copyrighted works of Plaintiff and the Class members.” “Books3” — a huge collection of 191,000 books that have been used to train GenAI systems — has been an ongoing source of legal trouble for the tech community. RedPajama has also been cited in a number of litigation cases. In September, a lawsuit against Apple claimed the company had used copyrighted material to train its Apple Intelligence model. The litigation mentioned the dataset and accused the tech company of copying protected works “without consent and without credit or compensation.” In October, a similar lawsuit against Salesforce also claimed the company had used RedPajama for training purposes.  Unfortunately for the tech industry, such lawsuits have, by now, become somewhat commonplace. AI algorithms are trained on massive datasets and, in some cases, those datasets have allegedly included pirated materials. In September, Anthropic agreed to pay $1.5 billion to a number of authors who had sued it and accused it of using pirated versions of their work to train its chatbot, Claude. The case was considered a potential turning point in the ongoing legal battles over copyrighted material in AI training data, of which there are many."
Amazon appoints longtime AWS exec Peter DeSantis to lead new AI org,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/amazon-appoints-longtime-aws-exec-peter-desantis-to-lead-new-ai-org/,"Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announced in a message to staff on Wednesday that longtime AWS executive Peter DeSantis will lead a new AI-focused organization within the company. This organization will be responsible for Amazon’s AI models like Nova, as well as silicon development and quantum computing, which help make AI tools faster and more efficient. DeSantis has spent 27 years at Amazon, including eight years as an SVP for AWS, the cloud provider that powers about one-third of the internet. At AWS’s recent re:Invent event, Amazon hammered home its commitment to AI for enterprise use, so it makes sense that the company is spinning out a new team from AWS leadership. “With our Nova 2 models just launched at re:Invent, our custom silicon growing rapidly, and the advantages of optimizing across models, chips, and cloud software and infrastructure, we wanted to free Peter up to focus his energy, invention cycles, and leadership on these new areas,” Jassy wrote. Amazon’s increasing emphasis on AI comes at a time when the company is eager to strengthen its foothold in the AI race, perhaps more through investments than its own innovations. Last month, AWS announced a $50 billion investment in the U.S. government’s AI infrastructure. Amazon is also reportedly in talks to invest $10 billion in OpenAI, and has already invested $8 billion in OpenAI rival Anthropic."
"Google launches Gemini 3 Flash, makes it the default model in the Gemini app",https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/google-launches-gemini-3-flash-makes-it-the-default-model-in-the-gemini-app/,"Google today released its fast and cheap Gemini 3 Flash model, based on the Gemini 3 released last month, looking to steal OpenAI’s thunder. The company is also making this the default model in the Gemini app and AI mode in search. The new Flash model arrives six months after Google announced the Gemini 2.5 Flash model, offering significant improvements. On the benchmark, the Gemini 3 Flash model outperforms its predecessor by a significant margin and matches the performance of other frontier models, like Gemini 3 Pro and GPT 5.2, in some measures. For instance, it scored 33.7% without tool use on Humanity’s Last Exam benchmark, which is designed to test expertise across different domains. In comparison, Gemini 3 Pro scored 37.5%, Gemini 2.5 Flash scored 11%, and the newly released GPT-5.2 scored 34.5%. On the multimodality and reasoning benchmark MMMU-Pro, the new model outscored all competitors with an 81.2% score. Google is making Gemini 3 Flash the default model in the Gemini app globally, replacing Gemini 2.5 Flash. Users can still choose the Pro model from the model picker for math and coding questions. The company says the new model is good at identifying multimodal content and giving you an answer based on that. For instance, you can upload your pickleball short video and ask for tips; you can try drawing a sketch and have the model guess what you are drawing; or you can upload an audio recording to get analysis or generate a quiz. The company also said the model better understands the intent of users’ queries and can generate more visual answers with elements like images and tables. You can also use the new model to create app prototypes in the Gemini app using prompts. The Gemini 3 Pro is now available to everyone in the U.S. for search and more people in the U.S. can access the Nano Banana Pro image model in search, as well. Google noted that companies like JetBrains, Figma, Cursor, Harvey, and Latitude are already using the Gemini 3 Flash model, which is available through Vertex AI and Gemini Enterprise. For developers, the company is making the model available in a preview model through the API and in Antigravity, Google’s new coding tool released last month. The company said the Gemini 3 Pro scores 78% on the SWE-bench verified coding benchmark, only outperformed by GPT-5.2. It added that the model is ideal for video analysis, data extraction, and visual Q&A, and because of its speed, it is suited for quick and repeatable workflows. Model pricing is $0.50 per 1 million input tokens and $3.00 per 1 million output tokens. This is slightly more expensive than $0.30 per 1 million input tokens and $2.50 per 1 million output tokens of Gemini Flash 2.5. But Google claims that the new model outperforms the Gemini 2.5 Pro model while being three times faster. And, for thinking tasks, it uses 30% fewer tokens on average than 2.5 Pro. That means overall, you might save on the number of tokens for certain tasks. “We really position flash as more of your workhorse model. So if you look at, for example, even the input and output prices at the top of this table, Flash is just a much cheaper offering from an input and output price perspective. And so it actually allows for, for many companies, bulk tasks,” Tulsee Doshi, senior director & head of Product for Gemini Models, told TechCrunch in a briefing Since it released Gemini 3, Google has processed over 1 trillion tokens per day on its API, amid its fierce release and performance war with OpenAI. Earlier this month, Sam Altman reportedly sent an internal “Code Red” memo to the OpenAI team after ChatGPT’s traffic dipped as Google’s market share in consumers rose. Post that, OpenAI has released GPT-5.2 and a new image generation model. OpenAI also boasted about its growing enterprise use and said the ChatGPT messages volume has grown 8x since November 2024. While Google didn’t directly address the competition with OpenAI, it said that the release of new models is challenging all companies to be active. “Just about what’s happening across the industry is like all of these models are continuing to be awesome, challenge each other, push the frontier. And I think what’s also awesome is as companies are releasing these models,” Doshi said. “We’re also introducing new benchmarks and new ways of evaluating these models. And so that’s also encouraging us.”"
"Mozilla’s new CEO says AI is coming to Firefox, but will remain a choice",https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/mozillas-new-ceo-says-ai-is-coming-to-firefox-but-will-remain-a-choice/,"Mozilla has appointed Anthony Enzor-DeMeo as its CEO as the Firefox browser maker scrambles to adapt in a rapidly changing browser market. The appointment comes at a time when web browsers are seeing a revitalization of sorts as AI changes how people use the internet. After more than a decade of dominating the market, incumbents like Firefox, Google Chrome, and Apple’s Safari are facing a fresh challenge from companies like Perplexity, Arc, OpenAI, and Opera, which are focused on baking AI models and agents into their browsers to bring AI to users at the first point of contact with the internet: the web browser. These changes don’t seem to be lost on Mozilla, which consists of several organizations, one of which is the Mozilla Corporation, which develops Firefox and other technologies, and another of which is its nonprofit and tax-exempt Mozilla Foundation, which oversees Mozilla’s corporate governance structure and sets the browser maker’s policies. The company has had a tough time lately: It’s gone through a restructuring, and last year laid off 30% of its employees and dropped its advocacy and global programs. But the potential to make a comeback amid the modern browser wars doesn’t seem to be lost on the company. Mozilla will be investing in AI and will add AI features to Firefox, Enzor-DeMeo said in a blog post announcing his appointment. That said, Mozilla seems intent on not infuriating users who’ve chosen Firefox for its lack of AI features: Enzor-DeMeo said the company will make AI features optional within Firefox and its other products. “AI should always be a choice — something people can easily turn off. People should know why a feature works the way it does and what value they get from it,” he wrote. The company will also be investing in diversifying its revenue beyond search (in exchange for having Google as its default search engine, Mozilla makes a significant portion of its revenue from the search giant), and Enzor-DeMeo said Mozilla plans to flesh Firefox out into “a broader ecosystem of trusted software.” Currently, the company also develops the Thunderbird email client, a VPN, and last year launched an AI-powered website creator aimed at small businesses. Before this appointment, Enzor-DeMeo was general manager of Firefox, and is now taking over from interim CEO, Laura Chambers, who was in the role for the past couple of years. Enzor-DeMeo previously held product roles at Roofstock, Better, and Wayfair. "
Google’s vibe-coding tool Opal comes to Gemini,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/googles-vibe-coding-tool-opal-comes-to-gemini/,"Google’s vibe-coding tool, Opal, is making its way to Gemini. The company on Wednesday said it is integrating the tool, which lets you build AI-powered mini apps, inside the Gemini web app, allowing users to create their own custom apps, which Google calls Gems. Introduced in 2024, Gems are customized versions of Gemini designed for specific tasks or scenarios. For instance, some of Google’s pre-made Gems include a learning coach, a brainstorming assistant, a career guide, a coding partner, and an editor. Opal, meanwhile, focuses on helping users create mini-apps or mix existing apps. To use the feature, users describe in natural language the app they want to make, and the tool will use the different Gemini models to create it. Now, Opal is directly available from Gemini on the web, where it’s found in the Gems manager. The tool has a visual editor that lays out the steps required to create an application. From the editor, users can rearrange steps and link them together, without writing code. Google notes that the visual editor also includes a new view in Gemini that will take the user’s written prompts and turn them into a list of steps. This makes it even easier to build apps and see how they work. For more advanced customization options, users can move from Gemini to the Advanced Editor at opal.google.com. The mini apps can be reused after they’re created. Known as “vibe-coding,” using AI to program and make apps has skyrocketed in popularity over the past couple of years. The market now has apps from startups like Lovable and Cursor, as well as offerings from AI providers like Anthropic and OpenAI. There are also tools focused more directly on consumers, like those from AI-powered app-building startup Wabi. Gemini’s web app is available at gemini.google.com."
Skana Robotics helps fleets of underwater robots communicate with each other,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/skana-robotics-helps-fleets-of-underwater-robots-communicate-with-each-other/,"Underwater autonomous vessels and robots could play a substantial role in defense operations, but submersibles have historically had trouble communicating across large distances unless they rose to the surface. But coming up to transmit poses the very obvious risk of being exposed. Skana Robotics thinks it’s made a breakthrough with underwater communications using AI — but not the large language models the industry touts today. Tel Aviv-based Skana has developed a new capability for its fleet management software system, SeaSphere, that allows groups of vessels to communicate with each other underwater across long distances using AI. The system allows vessels to share data and react to what they hear from other robots. This, Skana says, gives individual units the ability to autonomously adapt to the information they receive and change their course or task while still working toward the same general mission as the fleet. The startup says its software can also be used to secure underwater infrastructure and supply chains. “Communication between vessels is one of the main challenges during the deployment of multi-domain, multi-vessel operations,” Idan Levy, the co-founder and CEO of Skana Robotics, told TechCrunch. “The problem that we tackle is how you can deploy hundreds of unmanned vessels in an operation, share data, communicate on the surface level and under the water.” Teddy Lazebnik, an AI scientist and professor at the University of Haifa in Israel, led the research to develop this new capability. Lazebnik told TechCrunch that to build this decision-making algorithm, they couldn’t turn to the latest AI technology, but had to use AI algorithms that are a bit older and more mathematically driven. “The new algorithms have two properties: they are more powerful, but as a result, are less predictable,” Lazebnik said. “Hypothetically, you’re paying in the performance or the ‘wow effect’ of the of this algorithm, but the older ones, you gain explainability, predictability, and actually generality.” Skana Robotics was founded in 2024 and exited stealth mode earlier this year. The company is currently focused on selling to governments and companies in Europe, as maritime threat levels increase due to the war between Russia and Ukraine. Levy said the company is in talks for a sizable government contract that it hopes to close by the end of the year. In 2026, Skana hopes to release the commercial version of its product and start proving its tech out in the wild. “We want to show we can use this in scale,” Lazebnik said. “We argue that our software can handle complex maneuvers, etc. We want to show it. We claim we know how to manage an operation. We want admirals from EU and in EU countries to actually check this argument and see by themselves that we actually get results.”"
Amazon reportedly in talks to invest $10B in OpenAI as circular deals stay popular,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/amazon-reportedly-in-talks-to-invest-10b-in-openai-as-circular-deals-stay-popular/,"Amazon is in early discussions to invest as much as $10 billion in OpenAI in a deal that would see the AI lab using the e-commerce giant’s AI chips, CNBC reported. If it materializes, the deal would value OpenAI at more than $500 billion, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source. The Information was first to report on the story. Amazon has been looking to diversify its bets in the AI race, which has so far seen it partner up with and invest $8 billion in Anthropic, a rival to OpenAI. The e-commerce giant earlier this month also unveiled the latest iteration in its Trainium series of chips, and outlined the development of the next installment of those chips, complementing its cloud computing offerings via Amazon Web Services. News of the deal comes a couple months after OpenAI completed its transition to a for-profit model, which gives it more freedom to strike deals with investors other than Microsoft, one of the company’s earliest backers with a stake of 27%. Amazon investing in OpenAI would mark the latest in a series of circular deals in the AI space — major hardware manufacturers and cloud providers strike deals with young AI companies to use their products, while the upstarts commit to using their data centers and chips for training their AI models. This past March, OpenAI invested $350 million of equity into CoreWeave, which used the funds to buy chips from its backer Nvidia. Those same chips provide compute to OpenAI, which increases CoreWeave’s revenue and in the end makes OpenAI’s stake more valuable. Then in October, OpenAI signed a deal to pick up a 10% stake in AMD and committed to using the chipmaker’s AI GPUs, and also signed a chip usage agreement with Broadcom that month. And in November, the ChatGPT maker signed a $38 billion cloud computing deal with Amazon. OpenAI and Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment."
"Weeks after raising $100M, investors pump another $180M into hot Indian startup MoEngage",https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/weeks-after-raising-100m-investors-pump-another-180m-into-hot-indian-startup-moengage/,"MoEngage, a customer engagement platform used by consumer brands across 75 countries, has announced a Series F follow-on transaction just over a month after securing $100 million, with a majority of the latest funding providing liquidity to investors and employees through secondary transactions. In the latest raise, where $180 million traded hands altogether, about $123 million was secondary, including a $15 million employee tender that provided liquidity to 259 current and former employees, while the remaining $57 million was raised as primary capital and went into the business. The round was led by ChrysCapital and Dragon Funds, with participation from Schroders Capital and existing investors TR Capital and B Capital. Early backers, including Eight Roads Ventures, Helion Venture Partners, Z47, and Ventureast, sold shares in the secondary transactions. The deal valued MoEngage at “well over” $900 million post-money, per a person close to the deal, who added that the startup was tracking toward $100 million in annualized recurring revenue this year. MoEngage did not disclose these figures. MoEngage plans to use the fresh capital to invest further in its Merlin AI suite and expand its use of AI agents to improve decision-making and efficiency for marketing teams, said Raviteja Dodda (pictured above), co-founder and chief executive, in an interview. The startup is also pushing deeper into product and engineering teams by bundling its analytics and transactional messaging tools into a broader offering, a move it expects to lift average contract values and expand its addressable market. “When you look at customer engagement, it is not necessarily focused on marketing teams. There are product and engineering teams, which also focus on how to make sense of customer behavior and data,” Dodda said. MoEngage also plans to use part of its fresh capital raise to pursue strategic acquisitions, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, targeting software companies that complement its customer engagement platform or help accelerate its expansion in those markets. It also targets small AI teams to bolster its intelligence-led offerings. The 11-year-old startup, which has its headquarters in Bengaluru and San Francisco, already gets more than 30% of its revenue from North America, about 25% from Europe and the Middle East, and the remaining 45% from India and Southeast Asia. MoEngage’s secondary-heavy structure of the raise reflects its late-stage position, allowing early investors and employees to take liquidity without forcing the company into a near-term public listing. This approach gives MoEngage flexibility to choose its next steps based on business priorities rather than investor exit timelines. “It gives us the opportunity not to have an urgency with regard to going IPO,” Dodda said, adding that the startup still aims to go public in a couple of years, depending on market conditions and other factors. MoEngage expects to turn earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) positive this quarter and is targeting compound annual growth of about 35% over the next three years, Dodda said. Bhavin Turakhia, co-founder and chief executive of fintech firm Zeta, a MoEngage customer, said the startup’s analytics and messaging tools have helped it improve onboarding, activation, and cross-sell across key customer journeys. The secondary component of the round also enabled some early investors to exit fully. Ventureast, which backed MoEngage in 2018, is one of them. The VC firm recorded a roughly 10-times return on its investment on a blended basis, its partner Vinay Rao told TechCrunch. Rao said that while many global customer engagement companies operate with cost structures geared toward the U.S. market, MoEngage has retained an India-based cost structure, which he said has helped it compete more effectively in the U.S. while scaling the business. With the latest round, MoEngage has raised about $307 million in primary funding to date. Avendus advised MoEngage for the transaction."
"DoorDash rolls out Zesty, an AI social app for discovering new restaurants",https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/doordash-rolls-out-zesty-an-ai-social-app-for-discovering-new-restaurants/,"DoorDash is launching a new AI-powered social app that’s designed to help users quickly find local restaurants. The app, called Zesty, is initially available in the San Francisco Bay Area and New York. With the app, DoorDash is branching out beyond food delivery and stepping into the social and discovery space. The idea behind the app is to get rid of the need to read a bunch of different reviews, look up different menus, or browse TikTok when looking for a new place to eat. Once people open the app and sign in with their DoorDash accounts, they can ask an AI chatbot for personalized recommendations based on what they’re looking for. In an Instagram promo post, the company shared that users can type prompts like, “A low-key dinner in Williamsburg that’s actually good for introverts” to find specific recommendations. Users will also see suggested prompts, such as “Brunch spots good for groups,” and “Romantic dinner with a vintage feel.” DoorDash co-founder Andy Fang wrote in an X post that the app aggregates info across DoorDash, Google Maps, TikTok, and more to “curate the best suggestions from the web.” The app also learns your tastes to figure out what you do and don’t like. Once you come across a recommendation you’re interested in, you can save it and share it with others. Users can view and share photos and comments about restaurants they’ve visited, discover content from others, and follow people just like on any social network. “At DoorDash, we’re always looking for new ways to help people connect with the best of their communities,” a DoorDash spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch. “We’re piloting an app called Zesty to make it easier to discover great nearby restaurants, coffee shops, bars, and more through personalized search and social sharing. We’re excited to learn from early testers as we keep shaping what local discovery can look like.” News of the app’s launch was first reported by Bloomberg. Of course, some people may not want to download a whole new app to find new restaurants when they could simply use Google. For people who have already embedded AI into their daily lives, they may already be using services like ChatGPT and Gemini to discover new restaurants. However, the app could be a welcome launch for people who want to be part of a social network that’s all about discovering new restaurants. The launch of the new app marks DoorDash’s latest effort to branch beyond delivery services, as the company earlier this year launched features that allow customers to make reservations for in-person dining and earn in-store rewards."
Meta’s AI glasses can now help you hear conversations better,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/metas-ai-glasses-can-now-help-you-hear-conversations-better/,"Meta announced on Tuesday an update to its AI glasses that will allow you to better hear people talking when you’re in a noisy environment. The feature will initially become available on Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses in the U.S. and Canada, the company says. In addition, the glasses are getting another update that lets you use Spotify to play a song that matches what’s in your current view. For instance, if you’re looking at an album cover, the glasses could play a song by that artist. Or if you’re looking at your Christmas tree with a pile of gifts, you could play holiday music. This addition is more of a gimmick, of course, but it demonstrates how Meta is thinking about connecting what people see with actions they can take in their apps. The conversation-focus feature, meanwhile, seems more practical. First announced at Meta’s Connect conference earlier this year, the feature uses the AI glasses’ open-ear speakers to amplify the voice of the person you’re talking to. Meta says smart glasses wearers will also be able to adjust the amplification level by swiping the right temple of their glasses, or via the device settings. This will allow them to set the level more precisely to match their current environment, whether that’s a busy restaurant or bar, club, commuter train, or anything else. How well the feature works, of course, will still need to be tested. However, the idea of using smart accessories as tools to help with hearing isn’t limited to Meta. Apple’s AirPods already offer a Conversation Boost feature designed to help you focus on the person you’re talking to, and the Pro models more recently added support for a clinical-grade Hearing Aid feature as well. While the conversation-focus feature is limited to the U.S. and Canada, the Spotify feature is offered in English in a larger number of markets, including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Norway, Spain, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates, the U.K., and the U.S. The software update (v21) will first become available to those who are enrolled in Meta’s Early Access Program, which requires first joining a waitlist and being approved. It will later roll out more broadly. "
OpenAI continues on its ‘code red’ warpath with new image generation model,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/openai-continues-on-its-code-red-warpath-with-new-image-generation-model/,"OpenAI is rolling out a new version of ChatGPT Images that promises better instruction-following, more precise editing, and up to 4x faster image generation speeds. The new model, dubbed GPT Image 1.5, is available starting Tuesday to all ChatGPT users and via the API. It’s the latest escalation in the competition with Google’s Gemini after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman last month declared a “code red” in a leaked internal memo. The memo detailed OpenAI’s plans to regain its position as the AI leader after Google had begun to take market share following the release of Gemini 3, its latest flagship model, and Nano Banana Pro, the newest version of Google’s viral image generator — both of which have topped the LMArena leaderboard across multiple benchmarks.  Google maintains its lead even after OpenAI responded to its success last week with the launch of GPT-5.2, pitching it as its most advanced model yet for developers and everyday professional use. OpenAI had reportedly been planning to release a new image generator in early January, accelerating those plans with this week’s announcement. Its last image model release was GPT Image 1 in April.  GPT Image 1.5 arrives as image and video generators advance beyond prototypes and gain more production-ready capabilities. Like Nano Banana Pro, ChatGPT Image offers post-production features, providing more granular edit controls to maintain visual consistency, like facial likeness, lighting, composition, and color tone across edits.  Most GenAI image tools are bad at iteration, so this would be a huge step up. Asked for a specific change, like “adjust the facial expression” or “make lighting colder,” models will often reinterpret the entire image, leading to a lack of consistency.  The update isn’t just about new features. ChatGPT images will also now be accessible via a dedicated entry point in the ChatGPT sidebar that works “more like a creative studio,” Fidji Simo, OpenAI’s CEO of applications, wrote in a blog post Tuesday.  “The new image viewing and editing screens make it easier to create images that match your vision or get inspiration from trending prompts and preset filters,” Simo wrote. On top of the new image generator, OpenAI is introducing new ways to improve the ChatGPT experience with more visual elements. The plan is to make search queries display more visuals with clear sources, which could be helpful for tasks like converting measurements or checking sports scores, per Simo.  “When you’re creating, you should be able to see and shape the thing you’re making. When visuals tell a story better than words alone, ChatGPT should include them,” Simo wrote. “When you need a quick answer or the next step lives in another tool, it should be right there. As we do this, we can keep closing the distance between what’s in your mind and your ability to bring it to life.” pic.twitter.com/PwG1F4TT6Q"
Uber Eats alum lands $14M seed from a16z to fix WhatsApp chaos for LatAm’s doctors,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/uber-eats-alum-lands-14m-seed-from-a16z-to-fix-whatsapp-chaos-for-latams-doctors/,"Caroline Merin, who spent nearly a decade developing on-demand services as the first Latin American general manager for Uber Eats and later the COO of Rappi, recognized how badly healthcare tech lagged behind. While patients expected doctors to respond as quickly as their delivery apps, most medical professionals on the continent are forced to rely on WhatsApp for all patient communication. “I thought, as a patient, especially as an American, how incredible that I can text my doctor on WhatsApp, and they’ll respond,” she told TechCrunch. But Merin also realized just how overwhelming this communication method had become for physicians. “A doctor who sees 20 patients during the day, gets home, has 100 messages and is expected to answer immediately and remember who the patient is without the health record in front of them,” she said. Merin, who had long been interested in building her own startup, saw an opportunity to improve doctors’ communication challenges. So, two years ago, she launched Leona Health, an AI-copilot integrated with doctors’ WhatsApp accounts. On Tuesday, Leona revealed that it raised $14 million in seed funding led by Andreessen Horowitz, with participation from General Catalyst; Accel; Maven Clinic CEO Kate Ryder; Nubank CEO David Vélez; and Rappi CEO Simón Borrero. The startup also announced that its service is now available to doctors in 14 Latin American countries across 22 medical specialties. With Leona, patients continue to send messages on WhatsApp, but doctors receive and manage that communication through the startup’s mobile app. The app sorts all messages in order of priority, suggests responses, and allows other team members (like doctors or nurses) to reply to patients on the doctor’s behalf. The startup will also soon launch a fully autonomous agent that will handle conversational scheduling and simple intake. Solving the WhatsApp communication challenge in Latin America is critical because, according to Merin, patients in Latin America often choose their doctors based on their willingness to communicate using this channel. “These poor doctors, they’re receiving requests for very serious medical consults to, ‘I need a letter for my kids’ school,’ or, ‘I want a receipt for my appointment last week,’” Merin said. Since these messages can arrive in the evenings and on weekends, physicians are often forced to monitor their WhatsApp around the clock. Leona solves this by immediately alerting doctors only to the most serious health requests and allowing them to deprioritize more routine or administrative questions. “The idea is to help the doctor regain time,” Merin said. “We’re hearing from our users that they’re saving two to three hours a day by using Leona.” While Leona is starting by serving Latin America, the company’s long-term mission is to expand its services to other geographies, where, unlike in the U.S., patients also demand and are permitted to communicate with their doctors via WhatsApp, rather than through electronic medical records systems like Epic. Leona’s team of 13 is currently split between Mexico City and Silicon Valley, where, according to Merin, the best AI engineers are located."
Google tests an email-based productivity assistant,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/google-tests-an-email-based-productivity-assistant/,"Productivity is one space where companies keep wanting to experiment with AI assistants in the hope that they will save time for users, and as a result, they will want to use those assistants more. Google today launched one such experimental email-based assistant called CC through a Google Labs experiment. CC, which is powered by Gemini, can connect with your account, such as Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Calendar, and provide you with a daily brief via email. This “Your Day Ahead” email makes users aware of their tasks, summarizes their calendar, and provides key updates for the day from these accounts. You can also reply to or email CC at any time with requests such as adding to-dos, teaching it to your preferences, remembering notes, or searching for information. At the moment, CC is available to AI Pro and Ultra users in the U.S. and Canada who are 18 or above. The company said that the assistant is only available to consumer Google accounts at the moment and not Workspace accounts. There are several examples of AI-powered email-based briefs and assistants. Sequoia-backed Mindy, which now works in the creator and marketing space, started as an email assistant. Other meeting notetakers like Read AI and Fireflies also send users a daily brief, but they might not have context from email and Drive. Huxe, an audio app created by former Google NotebookLM makers, creates a daily brief in the form of a podcast with data from your email, calendar, and news preferences. "
Databricks raises $4B at $134B valuation as its AI business heats up,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/databricks-raises-4b-at-134b-valuation-as-its-ai-business-heats-up/,"The IPO window may have cracked open, but it seems some former startups have no intention of going public. Makes sense, in a way: IPOs were traditionally a way to raise money, and if you can manage to raise ungodly amounts without having to put your company through public scrutiny, why do it? Databricks is proving that point: The data intelligence company has just raised more than $4 billion in a Series L funding round at a $134 billion valuation — up 34% from the $100 billion valuation that it achieved just three months ago. This is Databricks’ third major venture fundraise in less than a year, and it comes as the company focuses on building products that address the needs of the AI revolution: a database for AI agents, an AI agent platform, and apps that let companies build and deploy data and AI applications. The company is investing heavily in its database for AI agents, known as Lakebase, which is based on the open source database Postgres (enabled by the $1 billion acquisition of a startup called Neon), and is aimed at corporate developers’ vibe-coding projects. Meanwhile, its AI agent platform, Agent Bricks, is aimed at helping businesses build and deploy AI agents that can tap into their data. The company has also struck hefty deals worth hundreds of millions with AI labs Anthropic and OpenAI to offer their models within its enterprise products. Series L rounds aren’t really common, but the fact that Databricks has managed to raise venture funding at ever-increasing valuations (it was valued at $60 billion around this time last year) indicates how strongly investors believe in the power of helping companies use data to fuel their AI efforts. Indeed, Databricks on Tuesday said it now generates run-rate revenue of more than $4.8 billion, up 55% from a year earlier, of which more than $1 billion came from its AI products. “The parallel rise of vibe coding and generative AI is accelerating the development of data-intelligent applications in the enterprise. Databricks will use this new capital to help customers build AI apps and agents on their proprietary data, leveraging Lakebase as the system of record, Databricks Apps as the user experience layer, and Agent Bricks to power multi-agent systems,” the company said in a press release. The Wall Street Journal reports that the company will also use the new money to add thousands of new jobs in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, as well as bring on more AI researchers. “Enterprises are rapidly reimagining how they build intelligent applications, and the convergence of generative AI with new coding paradigms is opening the door to entirely new workloads,” Databricks’ co-founder and CEO Ali Ghodsi said in a statement. The round was led by Insight Partners, Fidelity, and J.P. Morgan Asset Management. Andreessen Horowitz, BlackRock, Blackstone, Coatue, GIC, MGX, NEA, Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, Robinhood Ventures, T. Rowe Price Associates, Temasek, Thrive Capital, and Winslow Capital also participated. "
"Adobe Firefly now supports prompt-based video editing, adds more third-party models",https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/adobe-firefly-now-supports-prompt-based-video-editing-adds-more-third-party-models/,"Adobe is updating its AI video-generation app, Firefly, with a new video editor that supports precise prompt-based edits, as well as adding new third-party models for image and video generation, including Black Forest Labs’ FLUX.2 and Topaz Astra. Until now, Firefly only supported prompt-based generation, so you would have to recreate the entire clip if any part of the video was not to your liking. With the new editor, you can use text prompts to edit video elements, colors, and camera angles, and we also get a new timeline view that lets you adjust frames, sounds, and other characteristics easily. The company first announced the new video editor in October in private beta, and now it is rolling out to all users. The company said that using Runway’s Aleph model, users can give Firefly specific instructions, such as “Change the sky to overcast and lower the contrast” or “Zoom in slightly on the main subject.” And with Adobe’s own Firefly Video model, users can now do stuff like upload a start frame and a reference video of a camera motion and tell it to recreate that camera angle for the video they’re working on. The company also said users can now use the Topaz Labs’ Astra model to upscale videos to 1080p or 4K. Black Forest Labs’ FLUX.2 image generation model is coming to the app, too, along with a collaborative boards feature. The company said FLUX.2 will be available on Firefly across platforms immediately, and Adobe Express users will be able to use FLUX.2 from January. With competitors releasing new models for image and video generation, Adobe wants to lure users into engaging with its app more. Along with new updates to the Firefly app, the company said subscribers of the Firefly Pro, Firefly Premium, 7,000-credit, and 50,000-credit plans will get unlimited generations from all image models and the Adobe Firefly Video Model in the Firefly app until January 15. Adobe has made a ton of changes to its Firefly models and apps this year. In February, the company launched a subscription that let users access various levels of image and video generation; then it launched a new Firefly web app along with mobile apps later in the year, and has added support for more third-party models within the Firefly app."
Everbloom built an AI to turn chicken feathers into cashmere,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/everbloom-built-an-ai-to-turn-chicken-feathers-into-cashmere/,"Cashmere sweaters are everywhere these days, often at unbelievably low prices. The appeal is obvious: If you’ve ever worn cashmere, you know it’s soft, light, and warm — an impressive fiber that’s hard to give up. Unfortunately, those bargain prices usually come with a catch. Cashmere comes from the fine undercoat of a handful of goat breeds. Typically, one goat will be sheared twice a year, producing just four to six ounces (113 to 170 grams) of cashmere annually. That’s not a lot of supply for a growing market. “The producers of raw materials are actually under a lot of stress,” Sim Gulati, co-founder and CEO of Everbloom, told TechCrunch. “What you’re seeing now, especially with the advent of $50 cashmere sweaters, is that they’re being sheared way more often. The quality of the fiber is not as good, and it’s creating unsustainable herding practices.” Rather than try to change herding practices or convince consumers to only buy high-quality cashmere, Gulati and his team at Everbloom had a different idea. The startup, which has raised over $8 million from investors, including Hoxton Ventures and SOSV, set out to create an upcycled material that’s nearly indistinguishable from the real thing. To do this, Everbloom has created a material science AI called Braid.AI. The model can fine-tune various parameters to create fibers with different qualities. Cashmere is one target, but so are other materials widely used in the textile industry. At its core, Everbloom’s process is the same regardless of final product. To make its material, the company currently collects waste from across the fiber supply chain, including cashmere and wool farms and mills, as well as down bedding suppliers. In the future, it plans to expand to other waste sources, including feathers from the poultry industry. These waste streams share one thing in common: They’re all made of keratin, the key protein that underpins Everbloom’s process. The company then chops the waste to size and combines it with proprietary compounds. The mix is pressed through a plastic extrusion machine (which shapes material by forcing it through a die), and the pellets that come out the other end are fed through spinning machines that are normally used to produce polyester fiber. “That equipment is used for 80% of the textile market,” Gulati said. “You have to be a drop in replacement.” To transform waste into new fiber, all of the necessary chemical reactions occur within those two machines. Everbloom can create fibers that replicate everything from polyester to cashmere by using its AI to tweak the formulation and how the two machines process it. The startup said every fiber it produces should be biodegradable, even the polyester replacement.  “All the components that we’re using are biodegradable,” Gulati said, adding that his company is currently running its products through accelerated testing to prove the hypothesis. And because Everbloom uses waste products, the environmental impact will be dramatically lower, he said. Plus, it should be cheaper. “We want it to be more economically viable for brands and consumers,” Gulati said. “I don’t believe in a ‘sustainable premium’” — the idea that eco-friendly products should cost more. “In order for a material to be successful — both in the supply chain [and for] the consumer — you have to have both a product benefit and an economic benefit to everyone who touches the product. That’s what we’re aiming for.”"
VCs discuss why most consumer AI startups still lack staying power,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/vcs-discuss-why-most-consumer-ai-startups-still-lack-staying-power/,"Even three years after the generative AI boom started, most AI startups are still making money by selling to businesses, not individual consumers. Although consumers quickly adopted general-purpose LLMs like ChatGPT, most specialized consumer GenAI applications have yet to resonate. “A lot of early AI applications around video, audio, and photo were super cool,” said Chi-Hua Chien, co-founder and managing partner at Goodwater Capital, onstage at TechCrunch’s StrictlyVC event in early December. “But then Sora and Nano Banana came out, and the Chinese open sourced their video models. And so, a lot of those opportunities disappeared.” Chien compares some of those applications to the simple flashlight, which was initially a popular third-party download after the iPhone launched in 2008 but was quickly integrated into iOS itself. He argued that, just as it took a few years for the smartphone platform to solidify before game-changing consumer apps emerged, AI platforms need a similar period of “stabilization” for lasting AI consumer products to flourish. “I think we’re right on the cusp of the equivalent to mobile of the 2009-2010 era,” Chien said. That period was the birth of massive mobile-first consumer businesses like Uber and Airbnb. We could be seeing inklings of that stabilization with Google’s Gemini reaching technological parity with ChatGPT, Chien said. Elizabeth Weil, founder and partner at Scribble Ventures, echoed Chien’s sentiment about the early days of GenAI, describing the current state of consumer AI applications as being in an “awkward teenage middle ground.” What will it take for consumer AI startups to grow up? Possibly a new device beyond the smartphone. “It’s unlikely that a device that you pick up 500 times a day but only sees 3% to 5% of what you see is going to be what ultimately introduces the use cases that take full advantage of AI’s capabilities,” Chien said. Weil agreed that a smartphone may be too limiting for reimagining consumer AI products in large part because it is not ambient. “I don’t think we’re going to be building for this in five years,” she said, indicating her iPhone as she showed it to the audience. Startups and incumbent tech companies have been racing to build a new personal device that can supplant smartphones. OpenAI and Apple’s former design chief, Jony Ive, are working on what’s rumored to be a “screenless,” pocket-sized device. Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses are controlled by a wristband that detects subtle gestures. Meanwhile, a number of startups are trying, with often disappointing results, to introduce a pin, pendant, or ring that uses AI in a way different from how smartphones do.   However, not every AI consumer product will be dependent on a new device. Chien suggested that one such offering could be a personal AI financial adviser customized to the user’s specific needs. Similarly, Weil anticipates that a personalized, “always-on” tutor will become ubiquitous, with its specialized tutelage delivered directly from a smartphone. Though excited by AI’s potential, Weil and Chien expressed skepticism about the emergence of several, still-stealthy AI-powered social network startups. Chien said these companies are building networks where thousands of AI bots are interacting with the user’s content. “It turns social into a single-player game. I’m not sure that it works,” he said. “The reason that people enjoy social networking is the understanding that there are real humans on the other side.” "
OpenAI-backed biotech firm Chai Discovery raises $130M Series B at $1.3B valuation,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/openai-backed-biotech-firm-chai-discovery-raises-130m-series-b-at-1-3b-valuation/,"Chai Discovery, a biotech startup with backing from OpenAI, announced a $130 million Series B round at a $1.3 billion valuation on Monday. The round was led by General Catalyst and Oak HC/FT, the company said. Other participants include Menlo Ventures, OpenAI, Dimension, Thrive Capital, Neo, Yosemite venture fund, Lachy Groom, SV Angel, and new investors Glade Brook and Emerson Collective. The firm’s total funding now stands at over $225 million. The company is one in a growing industry that sees AI as a faster route toward drug development. In August, Menlo Ventures announced it was leading Chai’s $70 million Series A round. The investor described Chai as a startup that was building foundation models tuned for drug discovery, specifically to predict interactions between biochemical molecules so they could be reprogramed for cures. Chai says that its ambition is to “build the ‘computer-aided design suite’ for molecules.” Last year, the startup announced the Chai 1 AI model and is now offering Chai 2, it’s latest model. The company says Chai 2 is achieving significant improvements in success rates over other methods for de novo antibody design, meaning building custom antibodies from scratch, not modifying existing ones. “Our latest models can design molecules that have properties we’d want from actual drugs, and tackle challenging targets that have been out of reach,” Josh Meier, Chai’s co-founder and CEO said in a prepared statement. Previously, Meier, whose background is in machine learning, worked in research and engineering at Facebook and, prior to that, worked for OpenAI, according to his LinkedIn. Chai Discovery was founded in 2024, the profile notes.  "
Disney’s OpenAI deal is exclusive for just one year — then it’s open season,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/disneys-openai-deal-is-exclusive-for-just-one-year-then-its-open-season/,"Disney’s three-year licensing partnership with OpenAI includes just one of exclusivity, Disney CEO Bob Iger told CNBC. The company signed the partnership with OpenAI last week that will bring its iconic characters to the AI firm’s Sora video generator. Once that exclusive year is up, Disney is free to sign similar deals with other AI companies. The deal gives OpenAI a high-profile content partner, allowing users to draw on more than 200 characters from Disney, Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars to create content on Sora. For now, it’s the only AI platform that’s legally permitted to do so. For Disney, the deal offers a way to test the waters with generative AI and its intellectual property, letting the company assess how its partnership with OpenAI goes before pursuing additional agreements. “No human generation has ever stood in the way of technological advance, and we don’t intend to try,” Iger told CNBC. “We’ve always felt that if it’s going to happen, including disruption of our current business models, then we should get on board.” Tellingly, the same day that Disney announced its deal with OpenAI, the company sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google, alleging that the tech giant has infringed on its copyrights. Google didn’t confirm or deny Disney’s allegations but did say it will “engage” with the company."
Nvidia bulks up open source offerings with an acquisition and new open AI models ,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/nvidia-bulks-up-open-source-offerings-with-an-acquisition-and-new-open-ai-models/,"Nvidia continues to expand its footprint in open source AI on two fronts: an acquisition and a new model release. The semiconductor giant announced Monday it acquired SchedMD, the leading developer of popular open source workload management system Slurm. Nvidia said the company will continue to operate the program, which is designed for high-performance computing and AI, as an open source, vendor-neutral software. Slurm was originally launched in 2002 and SchedMD was founded in 2010 by the lead Slurm developers Morris Jette and Danny Auble. Auble is the current CEO of SchedMD. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed. Nvidia declined to comment on the news beyond the company’s blog post. Nvidia has been working with SchedMD for more than a decade and said in its blog post the technology is critical infrastructure for generative AI. The company plans to keep investing in the technology and “accelerate” its access to different systems. The semiconductor company also released a new family of open AI models on Monday. The company claimed this group of models, called Nvidia Nemotron 3, is the most “efficient family of open models” for building accurate AI agents. This model family includes the Nemotron 3 Nano, a small model for targeted tasks, the Nemotron 3 Super, a model built for multi-AI agent applications, and Nemotron 3 Ultra, built for more complicated tasks. “Open innovation is the foundation of AI progress,” Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, wrote in the company’s press release. “With Nemotron, we’re transforming advanced AI into an open platform that gives developers the transparency and efficiency they need to build agentic systems at scale.” In recent months, Nvidia has pushed to bolster its open source and open AI offerings. Last week, the company announced a new open reasoning vision language model, Alpamayo-R1, which is focused on autonomous driving research. The company also said at the time it added more workflows and guides covering its Cosmos world models, which are open source under a permissive license, to help developers better use the models to develop physical AI. The activity is reflective of Nvidia’s bet that physical AI will be the next frontier for its GPUs. Nvidia wants to be the go-to supplier for the many robotics — or self-driving vehicle — companies looking for the AI and software to develop the brains behind the technology. "
Creative Commons announces tentative support for AI ‘pay-to-crawl’ systems,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/creative-commons-announces-tentative-support-for-ai-pay-to-crawl-systems/,"After announcing earlier this year a framework for an open AI ecosystem, the nonprofit Creative Commons has come out in favor of “pay-to-crawl” technology — a system to automate compensation of website content when accessed by machines, like AI web crawlers. Creative Commons (CC) is best known for spearheading the licensing movement that allows creators to share their works while retaining copyright. In July, the organization announced a plan to provide a legal and technical framework for dataset sharing between companies that control the data and the AI providers that want to train on it. Now, the nonprofit is tentatively backing pay-to-crawl systems, saying it is “cautiously supportive.” “Implemented responsibly, pay-to-crawl could represent a way for websites to sustain the creation and sharing of their content, and manage substitutive uses, keeping content publicly accessible where it might otherwise not be shared or would disappear behind even more restrictive paywalls,” a CC blog post said. Spearheaded by companies like Cloudflare, the idea behind pay-to-crawl would be to charge AI bots every time they scrape a site to collect its content for model training and updates. In the past, websites freely allowed web crawlers to index their content for inclusion into search engines like Google. They benefited from this arrangement by seeing their sites listed in search results, which drove visitors and clicks. With AI technology, however, the dynamic has shifted. After a consumer gets their answer via an AI chatbot, they’re unlikely to click through to the source. This shift has already been devastating for publishers by killing search traffic, and it shows no sign of letting up. A pay-to-crawl system, on the other hand, could help publishers recover from the hit AI has had on their bottom line. Plus, it could work better for smaller web publishers that don’t have the pull to negotiate one-off content deals with AI providers. Major deals have been struck between companies like OpenAI and Condé Nast, Axel Springer and others; as well as between Perplexity and Gannett; Amazon and The New York Times; and Meta and various media publishers, among others. CC offered several caveats to its support for pay-to-crawl, noting that such systems could concentrate power on the web. It could also potentially block access to content for “researchers, nonprofits, cultural heritage institutions, educators, and other actors working in the public interest.” It suggested a series of principles for responsible pay-to-crawl, including not making pay-to-crawl a default setting for all websites and avoiding blanket rules for the web. In addition, it said that pay-to-crawl systems should allow for throttling, not just blocking, and should preserve public interest access. They should also be open, interoperable, and built with standardized components. Cloudflare isn’t the only company investing in the pay-to-crawl space. Microsoft is also building an AI marketplace for publishers, and smaller startups like ProRata.ai and TollBit have started to do so, as well. Another group called the RSL Collective announced its own spec for a new standard called Really Simple Licensing (RSL) that would dictate what parts of a website crawlers could access but would stop short of actually blocking the crawlers. Cloudflare, Akamai, and Fastly have since adopted RSL, which is backed by Yahoo, Ziff Davis, O’Reilly Media, and others. CC was also among those that announced its support for RSL, alongside CC signals, its broader project to develop technology and tools for the AI era. "
Lightspeed raises record $9B in fresh capital,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/lightspeed-raises-record-9b-in-fresh-capital/,"After a surge of VC investments from the 2021 bubble failed to yield strong returns from many venture firms, limited partners, such as endowments, pension plans, and sovereign wealth funds began to funnel a greater share of their capital into a select group of established firms with proven track records. The latest huge capital haul has come to Lightspeed Venture Partners. The 25-year-old venture firm announced Monday that it raised a total of $9 billion in fresh funds, the largest fundraise in firm’s history. At a time when very few companies have managed to IPO, Lightspeed was an early investor in Rubrik, Netskope, and Navan, all of which have recently made their public market debuts. The firm has also positioned itself as a predominantly AI-focused investor. Lightspeed claims to have backed 165 AI-native companies, including Anthropic, xAI, Databricks, Mistral, Glean, Abridge, and Skild AI. Armed with its giant new fund, the firm can continue to make massive investments into capital-intensive AI companies. For instance, Lightspeed reportedly wrote a $1 billion check to Anthropic when it co-led the LLM-maker’s $13 billion investment in September. Lightspeed’s new capital is spread across six funds, including a $3.3 billion opportunity fund dedicated to follow-on investments in its fastest-growing portfolio companies. Other large VC firms that have recently raised enormous capital pools include Founders Fund, which earlier this year amassed $4.6 billion for a growth fund, as well as General Catalyst’s $8 billion capital haul and Andreessen Horowitz’s $7.2 billion, both secured in 2024. Meanwhile, younger and smaller VC firms are struggling to attract fresh funds. According to PitchBook data, 2025 is on pace to record the fewest VC fund closings in the past 10 years."
Merriam-Webster names ‘slop’ the word of the year,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/merriam-webster-names-slop-the-word-of-the-year/,"AI’s impact on our social media feeds has not gone unnoticed by one of America’s top dictionaries. Amidst the onslaught of content that has swept the web over the past 12 months, Merriam-Webster announced Sunday that its word of the year for 2025 is “slop.” The dictionary defines the term as “digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence.” “Like slime, sludge, and muck, slop has the wet sound of something you don’t want to touch. Slop oozes into everything,” the dictionary writes, adding that, in an age of AI anxiety, it is a term designed to communicate “a tone that’s less fearful, more mocking” of the technology. “It’s such an illustrative word,” Merriam-Webster’s president, Greg Barlow, told The Associated Press. “It’s part of a transformative technology, AI, and it’s something that people have found fascinating, annoying, and a little bit ridiculous.” The word “slop” has certainly been everywhere this year, as journalists and commentators have sought to describe the ways in which platforms like OpenAI’s Sora and Google Gemini’s Veo are transforming the internet. Thanks to this new breed of media generator, there are now AI-generated books, podcasts, pop songs, TV commercials — even entire movies. One study in May claimed that nearly 75% of all new web content from the previous month had involved some kind of AI. These new tools have even led to what has been dubbed a “slop economy,” in which gluts of AI-generated content can be milked for advertising money. Critics worry that this trend is further polarizing digital communities, dividing them into those who can afford paywalled, higher-quality content, and those who can only afford a digital diet of slop, which — as you might imagine — can be quite light on informational value.  But “slop” has also been used to describe AI’s impact on a large variety of fields that don’t have much to do with traditional media consumption, including cybersecurity reports, legal briefings, and the college essay, among other things. Its impact is broad, to say the least. Relatedly, tech words have been big winners in the WOTY (word of the year) category this year. Macquarie Dictionary already beat out Merriam-Webster to make “AI slop” its annual term, while Oxford Dictionary chose “ragebait.” Collins Dictionary went with “vibe coding.”    "
First Voyage raises $2.5M for its AI companion that helps you build habits,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/first-voyage-raises-2-5m-for-its-ai-companion-helps-you-build-habits/,"In a world that’s rapidly filling up with AI-generated content, a startup called First Voyage wants to help people avoid all the AI slop blasted their way and instead build the habits they want. And it’s doing that by way of an AI companion app: Called Momo Self Care, the app offers a digital pet called Momo that you can take care of, and in return, it’ll remind you to complete habit-building tasks. Users can set up reminders for what tasks they want to complete, and Momo will remind you of them. Similar to the hit productivity app Focus Friend, Momo also rewards you with coins for completing tasks that can be used to purchase items within the app to further customize the pet. Users can also talk to Momo about self-care, and the AI companion will recommend habits and tasks based on what you want to achieve. “Momo helps users become the best versions of themselves, and users reward Momo with care, affection, and cute accessories,” co-founder and CEO Besart Çopa told TechCrunch. He launched the company with Egehan Ozsoy, who serves as CTO. On Monday, First Voyage said it had raised $2.5 million in a seed funding round from a16z speedrun, SignalFire, True Global, and other investors. Copa said Momo users have already created more than 2 million tasks on the platform, and the most popular habits relate to productivity, spirituality, and mindfulness. But with the wave of AI apps and toys hitting the market, not to mention the burgeoning influence of AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok, there’s increasing concern that these new, so-called “companions” can lead to more harm than good. Çopa, for one, believes that relationships between AI characters and humans will only increase in the next few years. However, he noted that the increasing number of AI apps aimed at wellness and self-care is at least better than those that target base urges. “We are happy so many founders [and] startups are working in the AI self-care wellness space instead of building waifus,” he said, adding that the “personalization capability of AI will take the impact of these relationships to another level.” He noted that Momo has baked in safety guardrails, such as prompt filters to make sure that conversations between the AI and users stay within appropriate boundaries. The fresh cash from the fundraise will be used to help launch Momo on the Android app store (it’s already available on iOS). The First Voyage team also hopes to make Momo more intelligent in how it interacts with people.   “We hope Momo and the community around it become a defining consumer brand that uses the best of AI, animation, and gamification to improve as many lives as possible,” Çopa said.

Nvidia reportedly weighs ramping up H200 production to meet surging demand in China,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/nvidia-is-reportedly-weighs-ramping-up-h200-production-to-meet-surging-demand-in-china/,"After successfully lobbying the Trump administration to approve the sale of its H200 chips to China, Nvidia is now thinking of ramping up production of the chips as Chinese companies rush to place orders, Reuters reported, citing anonymous sources. The most powerful of Nvidia’s previous Hopper generation of graphics processing units (GPUs) made for training large language models, the H200 chips previously could not be sold in China, as the previous Biden administration had proposed rules limiting sales of advanced AI chips in the country. But the Department of Commerce last week gave Nvidia the nod to sell H200 GPUs in China, in exchange for a 25% cut of sales of those chips. Nvidia is now seeing such strong demand from Chinese companies that it is considering adding more capacity, Reuters reported. However, Chinese officials are still deciding whether to allow the import of the H200 chips, which are said to be significantly more powerful than the H20 GPUs Nvidia had customized to sell in China. For the chipmaker, expanding production of the H200 GPUs would let it tap latent demand in a country that is racing to develop its own homegrown AI chips. Competition and national security concerns in the West have hampered the availability of the latest and most powerful hardware for training AI models in China, where companies have resorted to focusing on efficiency over sheer scale. Chinese companies, including Alibaba and ByteDance, which are developing their own AI models, have already been in touch with Nvidia to figure out large orders for the H200 chips, which are being produced in limited quantities, the report added. “We are managing our supply chain to ensure that licensed sales of the H200 to authorized customers in China will have no impact on our ability to supply customers in the United States,” an Nvidia spokesperson said in an emailed statement."
Mirelo raises $41M from Index and a16z to solve AI video’s silent problem,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/15/mirelo-raises-41m-from-index-and-a16z-to-solve-ai-videos-silent-problem/,"AI lets anyone create videos, but many AI video creation tools lack support for audio. Mirelo is building AI that adds soundtracks to match the video’s action. Earlier this year, the Berlin-based startup released Mirelo SFX v1.5, an AI model that interprets videos to add synced sound effects (SFX).  This attracted attention from VCs gearing up for a generative AI revolution in games. The two-year-old German startup has raised a $41 million seed round led by Index Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz, TechCrunch learned exclusively. This new capital will help Mirelo compete more effectively in its emerging category. While it was still in stealth mode and resource-constrained, large companies such as Sony and Tencent released video-to-SFX models. So did Kuaishou-owned Kling AI, out of China, and ElevenLabs, which is also backed by a16z. While Mirelo already differs from them by its narrower focus, beating these models in the long run requires the startup to make additional hires. Altogether, the startup expects its team of 10 people to “double if not triple” in headcount by the end of next year, Mirelo CEO and co-founder CJ Simon-Gabriel told TechCrunch. These new hires will support Mirelo’s R&D, as well as its product and go-to-market strategy. The startup published its models on Fal.ai and Replicate, and expects API usage to drive most of its revenue in the short term, Simon-Gabriel said. But it is also investing in building out its workspace for creators, Mirelo Studio, which could eventually support full professional use. As Mirelo prepares to scale, the startup and its investors are also anticipating concerns around training data that have dogged other generative AI companies. According to Georgia Stevenson, who led Index’s investments, Mirelo based its models on public and purchased sound libraries, and is signing revenue-sharing partnerships that respect artists’ rights.  It’s a tension inherent to generative AI tools, but Mirelo isn’t displacing musicians and sound designers — at least not yet. With a freemium model including a recommended plan for creators priced at €20/month (approximately $23.50), the startup is mostly targeting amateurs and prosumers hoping to unmute AI-generated videos. According to Simon-Gabriel, creators can’t fully benefit from this new potential without audio. “George Lucas said that sound is 50% of the movie-going experience. It’s not an overstatement,” he said. “If anything, it’s an understatement. You can take exactly the same images, and the sound will shape a completely different ambience, depending on the sound and the music that you put in there.”  He and his co-founder, Florian Wenzel, are both AI researchers and musicians themselves, and the startup has AI music generation on its roadmap. But Mirelo is seeing more pull for sound effects, in part because there is less research happening than in other AI fields, Simon-Gabriel said. “It’s easier to build a real moat here, and then to capitalize on it,” he noted. This could pay off for Mirelo. Simon-Gabriel declined to disclose its new valuation, but said it had increased “very significantly” compared to its previously undisclosed pre-seed round. That earlier round was led by Berlin-based firm Atlantic, which also participated in the new funding, bringing Mirelo’s total raised to $44 million and helping close its resource gap. The startup is also backed by angels who lend credibility to its technology and could open new doors, including Mistral CEO Arthur Mensch, Hugging Face chief science officer Thomas Wolf, Fal.ai co-founder Burkay Gur, and others. Still, the team is aware that AI-generated videos may not be mute for long. For instance, Gemini’s video generator now incorporates soundtracks powered by DeepMind’s Veo 3.1 video-to-audio model. But if anything, Simon-Gabriel sounds vindicated. “Now, suddenly, people realize, ‘Oh, maybe we should add sound.’ But, of course, you should add some. It’s a bit like silent movies versus talkies, right? It does make quite a difference!”"
Grok got crucial facts wrong about Bondi Beach shooting,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/14/grok-gets-the-facts-wrong-about-bondi-beach-shooting/,"Grok, the chatbot built by Elon Musk’s xAI and popularized on his social media platform X, appears to have repeatedly spread misinformation about today’s mass shooting at Bondi Beach in Australia. Gizmodo pointed to a number of posts where Grok misidentified the bystander — 43-year-old Ahmed al Ahmed — who disarmed one of the gunmen, and where it questioned the authenticity of videos and photos capturing al Ahmed’s actions. In one post, the chatbot misidentified the man in a photo as an Israeli hostage, and in another post brought up irrelevant information about the Israeli army’s treatment of Palestinians. In another post, it claimed a “43-year-old IT professional and senior solutions architect” named Edward Crabtree was the one who actually disarmed a gunman. Grok does appear to be fixing some of its mistakes. At least one post that reportedly claimed a video of the shooting actually showed Cyclone Alfred has been corrected “upon reevaluation.” And the chatbot subsequently acknowledged al Ahmed’s identity, writing that the “misunderstanding arises from viral posts that mistakenly identified him as Edward Crabtree, possibly due to a reporting error or a joke referencing a fictional character.” (The article in question appeared on a largely non-functional news site that may be AI-generated.)"
AI data center boom could be bad news for other infrastructure projects,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/13/ai-data-center-boom-could-be-bad-news-for-other-infrastructure-projects/,"Improvements to roads, bridges, and other infrastructure could take a hit as data center construction accelerates, according to Bloomberg. In 2025, state and local governments reportedly sold a record amount of debt for the second year in a row, with strategists predicting another $600 billion in sales next year. Most of that money is expected to fund infrastructure projects.  Meanwhile, Census Bureau data reportedly shows that private spending on data center construction was running at an annualized run rate of more than $41 billion — roughly the same as state and local government spending on transportation construction. All these projects are likely to compete for construction workers just as the industry faces labor shortages from retirements and President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. Andrew Anagnost, CEO of architecture and design software maker Autodesk, told Bloomberg there’s “absolutely no doubt” that data center construction “sucks resources from other projects. “I guarantee you a lot of those [infrastructure] projects are not going to move as fast as people want,” he said."
"OK, what’s going on with LinkedIn’s algo?",https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/12/ok-whats-going-on-with-linkedins-algo/,"One day in November, a product strategist we’ll call Michelle (not her real name), logged into her LinkedIn account and switched her gender to male. She also changed her name to Michael, she told TechCrunch.  She was partaking in an experiment called #WearthePants where women tested the hypothesis that LinkedIn’s new algorithm was biased against women.  For months, some heavy LinkedIn users complained about seeing drops in engagement and impressions on the career-oriented social network. This came after the company’s vice president of engineering, Tim Jurka, said in August that the platform had “more recently” implemented LLMs to help surface content useful to users.  Michelle (whose identity is known to TechCrunch) was suspicious about the changes because she has more than 10,000 followers and ghostwrites posts for her husband, who has only around 2,000. Yet she and her husband tend to get around the same number of post impressions, she said, despite her larger following.  “The only significant variable was gender,” she said.  Marilynn Joyner, a founder, also changed her profile gender. She’s been posting on LinkedIn consistently for two years and noticed in the last few months that her posts’ visibility declined. “I changed my gender on my profile from female to male, and my impressions jumped 238% within a day,” she told TechCrunch. Megan Cornish reported similar results, as did Rosie Taylor, Jessica Doyle Mekkes, Abby Nydam, Felicity Menzies, Lucy Ferguson, and so on.   LinkedIn said that its “algorithm and AI systems do not use demographic information such as age, race, or gender as a signal to determine the visibility of content, profile, or posts in the Feed” and that “a side-by-side snapshot of your own feed updates that are not perfectly representative, or equal in reach, do not automatically imply unfair treatment or bias” within the Feed.  Social algorithm experts agree that explicit sexism may not have been a cause, although implicit bias may be at work.   Platforms are “an intricate symphony of algorithms that pull specific mathematical and social levers, simultaneously and constantly,” Brandeis Marshall, a data ethics consultant, told TechCrunch.   “The changing of one’s profile photo and name is just one such lever,” she said, adding that the algorithm is also influenced by, for example, how a user has and currently interacts with other content.   “What we don’t know of is all the other levers that make this algorithm prioritize one person’s content over another. This is a more complicated problem than people assume,” Marshall said.  The #WearthePants experiment began with two entrepreneurs — Cindy Gallop and Jane Evans. They asked two men to make and post the same content as them, curious to know if gender was the reason so many women were feeling a dip in engagement. Gallop and Evans both have sizable followings — more than 150,000 combined compared to the two men who had around 9,400 at the time.  Gallop reported that her post reached only 801 people, while the man who posted the exact same content reached 10,408 people, more than 100% of his followers. Other women then took part. Some, like Joyner, who uses LinkedIn to market her business, became concerned. “I’d really love to see LinkedIn take accountability for any bias that may exist within its algorithm,” Joyner said.  But LinkedIn, like other LLM-dependent search and social media platforms, offers scant details on how content-picking models were trained. Marshall said that most of these platforms “innately have embedded a white, male, Western-centric viewpoint” due to who trained the models. Researchers find evidence of human biases like sexism and racism in popular LLM models because the models are trained on human-generated content, and humans are often directly involved in post-training or reinforcement learning.  Still, how any individual company implements its AI systems is shrouded in the secrecy of the algorithmic black box.  LinkedIn says that the #WearthePants experiment could not have demonstrated gender bias against women. Jurka’s August statement said — and LinkedIn’s Head of Responsible AI and Governance, Sakshi Jain, reiterated in another post in November — that its systems are not using demographic information as a signal for visibility.  Instead, LinkedIn told TechCrunch that it tests millions of posts to connect users to opportunities. It said demographic data is used only for such testing, like seeing if posts “from different creators compete on equal footing and that the scrolling experience, what you see in the feed, is consistent across audiences,” the company told TechCrunch. LinkedIn has been noted for researching and adjusting its algorithm to try to provide a less biased experience for users. It’s the unknown variables, Marshall said, that probably explain why some women saw increased impressions after changing their profile gender to male. Partaking in a viral trend, for example, can lead to an engagement boost; some accounts were posting for the first time in a long time, and the algorithm could have possibly rewarded them for doing so.  Tone and writing style might also play a part. Michelle, for example, said the week she posted as “Michael,” she adjusted her tone slightly, writing in a more simplistic, direct style, as she does for her husband. That’s when she said impressions jumped 200% and engagements rose 27%. She concluded the system was not “explicitly sexist,” but seemed to deem communication styles commonly associated with women “a proxy for lower value.”  Stereotypical male writing styles are believed to be more concise, while the writing style stereotypes for women are imagined to be softer and more emotional. If an LLM is trained to boost writing that complies with male stereotypes, that’s a subtle, implicit bias. And as we previously reported, researchers have determined that most LLMs are riddled with them. Sarah Dean, an assistant professor of computer science at Cornell, said that platforms like LinkedIn often use entire profiles, in addition to user behavior, when determining content to boost. That includes jobs on a user’s profile and the type of content they usually engage with. “Someone’s demographics can affect ‘both sides’ of the algorithm — what they see and who sees what they post,” Dean said.  LinkedIn told TechCrunch that its AI systems look at hundreds of signals to determine what is pushed to a user, including insights from a person’s profile, network, and activity.  “We run ongoing tests to understand what helps people find the most relevant, timely content for their careers,” the spokesperson said. “Member behavior also shapes the feed, what people click, save, and engage with changes daily, and what formats they like or don’t like. This behavior also naturally shapes what shows up in feeds alongside any updates from us.” Chad Johnson, a sales expert active on LinkedIn, described the changes as deprioritizing likes, comments, and reposts. The LLM system “no longer cares how often you post or at what time of day,” Johnson wrote in a post. “It cares whether your writing shows understanding, clarity, and value.” All of this makes it hard to determine the true cause of any #WearthePants results. Nevertheless, it seems like many people, across genders, either don’t like or don’t understand LinkedIn’s new algorithm — whatever it is.  Shailvi Wakhlu, a data science consultant, told TechCrunch that she’s averaged at least one post a day for five years and used to see thousands of impressions. Now she and her husband are lucky to see a few hundred. “It’s demotivating for content creators with a large loyal following,” she said. One man told TechCrunch he saw about a 50% drop in engagement over the past few months. Still, another man said he’s seen post impressions and reach increase more than 100% in a similar time span. “This is largely because I write on specific topics for specific audiences, which is what the new algorithm is rewarding,” he told TechCrunch, adding that his clients are seeing a similar increase.  But in Marshall’s experience, she, who is Black, believes posts about her experiences perform more poorly than posts related to her race. “If Black women only get interactions when they talk about black women but not when they talk about their particular expertise, then that’s a bias,” she said.  The researcher, Dean, believes the algorithm may simply be amplifying “whatever signals there already are.” It could be rewarding certain posts, not because of the demographics of the writer, but because there’s been more of a history of response to them across the platform. While Marshall may have stumbled into another area of implicit bias, her anecdotal evidence isn’t enough to determine that with certainty. LinkedIn offered some insights into what works well now. The company said the user base has grown, and as a result, posting is up 15% year-over-year while comments are up 24% YOY. “This means more competition in the feed,” the company said. Posts about professional insights and career lessons, industry news and analysis, and education or informative content around work, business, and the economy are all doing well, it said.  If anything, people are just confused. “I want transparency,” Michelle said.  However, as content-picking algorithms have always been closely guarding secrets by their companies, and transparency can lead to gaming them, that’s a big ask. It’s one that’s unlikely ever to be satisfied.  This article was updated to correct the spelling of Wakhlu’s name."
Trump’s AI executive order promises ‘one rulebook’ — startups may get legal limbo instead,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/12/trumps-ai-executive-order-promises-one-rulebook-startups-may-get-legal-limbo-instead/,"President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday evening that directs federal agencies to challenge state AI laws, arguing that startups need relief from a “patchwork” of rules. Legal experts and startups meanwhile say the order could prolong uncertainty, sparking court battles that leave young companies navigating shifting state requirements while waiting to see if Congress can agree on a single national framework.  The order, titled “Ensuring a National Policy Framework for Artificial Intelligence,” directs the Department of Justice to set up a task force within 30 days to challenge certain state laws on the grounds that AI is interstate commerce and should be regulated federally. It gives the Commerce Department 90 days to compile a list of “onerous” state AI laws, an assessment that could affect states’ eligibility for federal funds, including broadband grants. The order also asks the Federal Trade Commission and Federal Communications Commission to explore federal standards that could preempt state rules and instructs the administration to work with Congress on a uniform AI law.  The order lands amid a broader push to rein in state-by-state AI rules after efforts in Congress to pause state regulation stalled. Lawmakers in both parties have argued that without a federal standard, blocking states from acting could leave consumers exposed and companies largely unchecked. “This David Sacks-led executive order is a gift for Silicon Valley oligarchs who are using their influence in Washington to shield themselves and their companies from accountability,” said Michael Kleinman, head of U.S. Policy at the Future of Life Institute, which focuses on reducing extreme risks from transformative technologies, in a statement.  Sacks, Trump’s AI and crypto policy czar, has been a leading voice behind the administration’s AI preemption push. Even supporters of a national framework concede the order doesn’t create one. With state laws still enforceable unless courts block them or states pause enforcement, startups could face an extended transition period. Sean Fitzpatrick, CEO of LexisNexis North America, U.K., and Ireland, tells TechCrunch that states will defend their consumer protection authority in court, with cases likely escalating to the Supreme Court.  While supporters argue the order could reduce uncertainty by centralizing the fight over AI regulation in Washington, critics say the legal battles will create immediate headwinds for startups navigating conflicting state and federal demands.  “Because startups are prioritizing innovation, they typically do not have … robust regulatory governance programs until they reach a scale that requires a program,” Hart Brown, principal author of Oklahoma governor Kevin Stitt’s Task Force on AI and Emerging Technology recommendations, told TechCrunch. “These programs can be expensive and time-consuming to meet a very dynamic regulatory environment.” Arul Nigam, co-founder at Circuit Breaker Labs, a startup that performs red-teaming for conversational and mental health AI chatbots, echoed those concerns. “There’s uncertainty in terms of, do [AI companion and chatbot companies] have to self-regulate?” Nigam told TechCrunch, noting that the patchwork of state AI laws does hurt smaller startups in his field. “Are there open source standards they should adhere to? Should they continue building?” He added that he is hopeful Congress can move more quickly now to pass a stronger federal framework.  Andrew Gamino-Cheong, CTO and co-founder of AI governance company Trustible, told TechCrunch the EO will backfire on AI innovation and pro-AI goals: “Big Tech and the big AI startups have the funds to hire lawyers to help them figure out what to do, or they can simply hedge their bets. The uncertainty does hurt startups the most, especially those that can’t get billions of funding almost at will,” he said. He added that legal ambiguity makes it harder to sell to risk-sensitive customers like legal teams, financial firms, and healthcare organizations, increasing sales cycles, systems work, and insurance costs. “Even the perception that AI is unregulated will reduce trust in AI,” which is already low and threatens adoption, Gamino-Cheong said. Gary Kibel, a partner at Davis + Gilbert, said businesses would welcome a single national standard, but “an executive order is not necessarily the right vehicle to override laws that states have duly enacted.” He warned that the current uncertainty leaves open two extremes: highly restrictive rules or no action at all, either of which could create a “Wild West” that favors Big Tech’s ability to absorb risk and wait things out. Meanwhile, Morgan Reed, president of The App Association, urged Congress to quickly enact a “comprehensive, targeted, and risk-based national AI framework. We can’t have a patchwork of state AI laws, and a lengthy court fight over the constitutionality of an Executive Order isn’t any better.”"
Google Translate now lets you hear real-time translations in your headphones,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/12/google-translate-now-lets-you-hear-real-time-translations-in-your-headphones/,"Google is rolling out a beta experience that lets you hear real-time translations in your headphones, the company announced on Friday. The tech giant is also bringing advanced Gemini capabilities to Google Translate and expanding its language-learning tools in the Translate app. The new real-time headphone translations experience keeps each speaker’s tone, emphasis, and cadence intact, so it’s easier to follow the conversation and tell who’s saying what, Google says. The new capability essentially turns any pair of headphones into a real-time, one-way translation device. “Whether you’re trying to have a conversation in a different language, listen to a speech or lecture while abroad, or watch a TV show or film in another language, you can now put in your headphones, open the Translate app, tap ‘Live translate’ and hear a real-time translation in your preferred language,” said Rose Yao, Google VP Product Management, Search Verticals, in the blog post. The beta is rolling out now in the Translate app on Android in the U.S., Mexico, and India. The feature works with any pair of headphones and supports more than 70 languages. The company plans to bring the capability to iOS and more countries in 2026. As for the advanced Gemini capabilities coming to Translate, Google says they will enable smarter, more natural, and accurate text translations. They’ll also enable improved translations of phrases with more nuanced meanings, like slang, idioms, or local expressions. For example, if you’re trying to translate an English idiom like “stealing my thunder,” you’ll now get a more accurate translation instead of a literal word-for-word translation, as Gemini will parse the context to capture what the idiom really means. This update is rolling out now in the U.S. and India, translating between English and nearly 20 languages, including Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, and German. The update is available in the Translate app on Android, iOS, and on the web. Google is also expanding its language learning tools to almost 20 new countries, including Germany, India, Sweden, and Taiwan. English speakers can now practice German, while Bengali, Mandarin Chinese (Simplified), Dutch, German, Hindi, Italian, Romanian, and Swedish speakers can practice English. The tech giant is also adding improved feedback so you can get helpful tips based on your speaking practice. Additionally, Google is adding a feature that tracks how many days in a row you’ve been learning, making it easier to see your progress and stay consistent. While the tools were already designed to take on Duolingo, this new feature brings the experience even closer to the popular language-learning app."
Google launched its deepest AI research agent yet — on the same day OpenAI dropped GPT-5.2,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/google-launched-its-deepest-ai-research-agent-yet-on-the-same-day-openai-dropped-gpt-5-2/,"Google released on Thursday a “reimagined” version of its research agent Gemini Deep Research based on its much-ballyhooed state-of-the-art foundation model, Gemini 3 Pro.   This new agent isn’t just designed to produce research reports — although it can still do that. It now allows developers to embed Google’s SATA-model research capabilities into their own apps. That capability is made possible through Google’s new Interactions API, which is designed to give devs more control in the coming agentic AI era.  The new Gemini Deep Research tool is an agent equipped to synthesize mountains of information and handle a large context dump in the prompt. Google says it’s used by customers for tasks ranging from due diligence to drug toxicity safety research.  Google also says it will soon be integrating this new deep research agent into services, including Google Search, Google Finance, its Gemini App, and its popular NotebookLM. This is another step toward preparing for a world where humans don’t Google anything anymore — their AI agents do.  The tech giant says that Deep Research benefits from Gemini 3 Pro’s status as its “most factual” model that is trained to minimize hallucinations during complex tasks. AI hallucinations — where the LLM just makes stuff up — are an especially crucial issue for long-running, deep reasoning agentic tasks, in which many autonomous decisions are made over minutes, hours, or longer. The more choices an LLM has to make, the greater the chance that even one hallucinated choice will invalidate the entire output.  To prove its progress claims, Google has also created yet another benchmark (as if the AI world needs another one). The new benchmark is unimaginatively named DeepSearchQA and is intended to test agents on complex, multi-step information-seeking tasks. Google has open sourced this benchmark.   It also tested Deep Research on Humanity’s Last Exam, a much more interestingly named, independent benchmark of general knowledge filled with impossibly niche tasks; and BrowserComp, a benchmark for browser-based agentic tasks. As you might expect, Google’s new agent bested the competition on its own benchmark, and Humanity’s. However, OpenAI’s ChatGPT 5 Pro was a surprisingly close second all the way around and slightly bested Google on BrowserComp.  But those benchmark comparisons were obsolete almost the moment Google published them. Because on the same day, OpenAI launched its highly anticipated GPT 5.2 — codenamed Garlic. OpenAI says its newest model bests its rivals — especially Google — on a suite of the typical benchmarks, including OpenAI’s homegrown one.  Perhaps one of the most interesting parts of this announcement was the timing. Knowing that the world was awaiting the release of Garlic, Google dropped some AI news of its own."
1X struck a deal to send its ‘home’ humanoids to factories and warehouses,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/1x-struck-a-deal-to-send-its-home-humanoids-to-factories-and-warehouses/,"Robotics company 1X found some big potential buyers for its humanoid robots designed for consumers — the portfolio companies of one of its investors. The company announced a strategic partnership to make thousands of its humanoid robots available for EQT’s portfolio companies on Thursday. EQT is a large Swedish multi-asset investor, and its venture fund EQT Ventures, is one of 1X’s backers. This deal involves shipping up to 10,000 1X Neo humanoid robots between 2026 and 2030 to EQT’s more than 300 portfolio companies with a concentration on manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, and other industrial use cases. 1X will sign individual deals with each of EQT’s interested portfolio companies, 1X confirmed to TechCrunch. This partnership is particularly interesting because 1X’s Neo has been marketed as a humanoid for personal use and tagged as the “first consumer-ready humanoid robot designed to transform life at home.” Unlike some of 1X’s peers, like Figure, it has not been marketed as a bot for commercial purposes. 1X does have a robot designed for industrial purposes, Eve Industrial, but this deal specifically involves the Neo humanoid. When the company opened up preorders for the $20,000 robot in October, the announcement was focused on how the robot would operate in someone’s home from descriptions of the different chores that the robot is able to perform and how it interacts with people. This deal is quite a different use case. That’s likely because humanoids for the home will remain a hard sell for quite some time while industrial use cases are an easier sell. The $20,000 price tag automatically limits the potential pool of consumer customers too. The Neo specifically also comes with a privacy element that would be hard to swallow for many people — human operators from 1X are able to look through the robots eyes into someone’s home. Humanoids also come with potential safety issues around pets and small children due to their size and instability. Multiple VCs and scientists in the robotics field told TechCrunch this summer that humanoid adoption wouldn’t be for multiple years, if not a decade away. The company declined to share how many preorders it received for its Neo bot but a spokesperson said preorders “far exceeded” the company’s goal. Founded in 2014, 1x has since raised more than $130 million in venture capital from firms, including EQT Ventures, Tiger Global, and the OpenAI Startup Fund, among others."
Disney hits Google with cease-and-desist claiming ‘massive’ copyright infringement,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/disney-hits-google-with-cease-and-desist-claiming-massive-copyright-infringement/,"Disney sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google on Wednesday, alleging that the tech giant has infringed on its copyrights, Variety reports. Disney is accusing the tech giant of copyright infringement on a “massive scale,” claiming it has used AI models and services to commercially distribute unauthorized images and videos, according to the letter seen by Variety. “Google operates as a virtual vending machine, capable of reproducing, rendering, and distributing copies of Disney’s valuable library of copyrighted characters and other works on a mass scale,” the letter reads. “And compounding Google’s blatant infringement, many of the infringing images generated by Google’s AI Services are branded with Google’s Gemini logo, falsely implying that Google’s exploitation of Disney’s intellectual property is authorized and endorsed by Disney.” The letter alleges that Google’s AI systems infringe characters from “Frozen,” “The Lion King,” “Moana,” “The Little Mermaid,” “Deadpool,” and more. Google didn’t confirm or deny Disney’s allegations but did say it will “engage” with the company. “We have a longstanding and mutually beneficial relationship with Disney, and will continue to engage with them. More generally, we use public data from the open web to build our AI and have built additional innovative copyright controls like Google-extended and Content ID for YouTube, which give sites and copyright holders control over their content,” a spokesperson said. Disney’s move comes the same day that it signed a $1 billion, three-year deal with OpenAI that will bring its iconic characters to the company’s Sora AI video generator. "
Google’s AI try-on feature for clothes now works with just a selfie,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/googles-ai-try-on-feature-for-clothes-now-works-with-just-a-selfie/,"Google is updating its AI try-on feature to let you virtually try on clothes using just a selfie, the company announced on Thursday. In the past, users had to upload a full-body picture of themselves to virtually try on a piece of clothing. Now they can use a selfie and Nano Banana, Google’s Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model, to generate a full-body digital version of themselves for virtual try-ons. Users can select their usual clothing size, and the feature will then generate several images. From there, users can choose one to make it their default try-on photo. If desired, users still have the option to use a full-body photo or select from a range of models with diverse body types. The new capability is launching in the United States today. Google first launched the try-on feature in July, allowing users to try on apparel items from its Shopping Graph across Search, Google Shopping, and Google Images. To use the feature, users need to tap on a product listing or apparel product result and select the “try it on” icon. The move comes as Google has been investing in the virtual AI try-on space, as the company has a separate app dedicated specifically to that purpose. The app, called Doppl, is designed to help visualize how different outfits might look on you using AI. Earlier this week, the tech giant updated it with a shoppable discovery feed that displays recommendations so users can discover and virtually try on new items. Nearly everything in the feed is shoppable, with direct links to merchants. The discovery feed features AI-generated videos of real products and suggests outfits based on your personalized style. While some may not be fond of an AI-generated feed, Google likely views it as a way to showcase products in a format that people are already familiar with, thanks to platforms like TikTok and Instagram."
OpenAI fires back at Google with GPT-5.2 after ‘code red’ memo,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/openai-fires-back-at-google-with-gpt-5-2-after-code-red-memo/,"OpenAI launched its latest frontier model, GPT-5.2, on Thursday amid increasing competition from Google, pitching it as its most advanced model yet and one designed for developers and everyday professional use.  OpenAI’s GPT-5.2 is coming to ChatGPT paid users and developers via the API in three flavors: Instant, a speed-optimized model for routine queries like information-seeking, writing, and translation; Thinking, which excels at complex structured work like coding, analyzing long documents, math, and planning; and Pro, the top-end model aimed at delivering maximum accuracy and reliability for difficult problems.  “We designed 5.2 to unlock even more economic value for people,” Fidji Simo, OpenAI’s chief product officer, said Thursday during a briefing with journalists. “It’s better at creating spreadsheets, building presentations, writing code, perceiving images, understanding long context, using tools and then linking complex, multi-step projects.” GPT-5.2 lands in the middle of an arms race with Google’s Gemini 3, which is topping LMArena’s leaderboard across most benchmarks (apart from coding — which Anthropic’s Claude Opus-4.5 still has on lock). Early this month, The Information reported that CEO Sam Altman released an internal “code red” memo to staff amid ChatGPT traffic decline and concerns that it is losing consumer market share to Google. The code red called for a shift in priorities, including stalling on commitments like introducing ads and instead focusing on creating a better ChatGPT experience.  GPT-5.2 is OpenAI’s push to reclaim leadership, even as some employees reportedly asked for the model release to be pushed back so the company could have more time to improve it. And despite indications that OpenAI would focus its attention on consumer use cases by adding more personalization and customization to ChatGPT, the launch of GPT-5.2 looks to beef up its enterprise opportunities.  The company is specifically targeting developers and the tooling ecosystem, aiming to become the default foundation for building AI-powered applications. Earlier this week, OpenAI released new data showing enterprise usage of its AI tools has surged dramatically over the past year.  This comes as Gemini 3 has become tightly integrated into Google’s product and cloud ecosystem for multimodal and agentic workflows. Google this week launched managed MCP servers that make its Google and Cloud services like Maps and BigQuery easier for agents to plug into. (MCPs are the connectors between AI systems and data and tools.) OpenAI says GPT-5.2 sets new benchmark scores in coding, math, science, vision, long-context reasoning, and tool use, which the company claims could lead to “more reliable agentic workflows, production-grade code, and complex systems that operate across large contexts and real-world data.” Those capabilities put it in direct competition with Gemini 3’s Deep Think mode, which has been touted as a major reasoning advancement targeting math, logic, and science. On OpenAI’s own benchmark chart, GPT-5.2 Thinking edges out Gemini 3 and Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4.5 in nearly every listed reasoning test, from real-world software engineering tasks (SWE-Bench Pro) and doctoral-level science knowledge (GPQA Diamond) to abstract reasoning and pattern discovery (ARC-AGI suites).  Research lead Aidan Clark said that stronger math scores aren’t just about solving equations. Mathematical reasoning, he explained, is a proxy for whether a model can follow multi-step logic, keep numbers consistent over time, and avoid subtle errors that could compound over time.  “These are all properties that really matter across a wide range of different workloads,” Clark said. “Things like financial modeling, forecasting, doing an analysis of data.” During the briefing, OpenAI product lead Max Schwarzer said GPT-5.2 “makes substantial improvements to code generation and debugging” and can walk through complex math and logic step by step. Coding startups like Windsurf and CharlieCode, he added, report “state-of-the-art agent coding performance” and measurable gains on complex multi-step workflows. Beyond coding, Schwarzer said that GPT-5.2 Thinking responses contain 38% fewer errors than its predecessor, making the model more dependable for day-to-day decision-making, research, and writing.  GPT-5.2 appears to be less a reinvention and more of a consolidation of OpenAI’s last two upgrades. GPT-5, which dropped in August, was a reset that laid the groundwork for a unified system with a router to toggle the model between a fast default model and a deeper “Thinking” mode. November’s GPT-5.1 focused on making that system warmer, more conversational, and better suited to agentic and coding tasks. The latest model, GPT-5.2, seems to turn up the dial on all of those advancements, making it a more reliable foundation for production use.  For OpenAI, the stakes have never been higher. The company has made commitments to the tune of $1.4 trillion for AI infrastructure buildouts over the next few years to support its growth — commitments it made when it still had the first-mover advantage among AI companies. But now that Google, which lagged behind at the start, is pushing ahead, that bet might be what’s driving Altman’s “code red.”  OpenAI’s renewed focus on reasoning models is also a risky flex. The systems behind its Thinking and Deep Research modes are more expensive to run than standard chatbots because they chew through more compute. By doubling down on that kind of model with GPT-5.2, OpenAI may be setting up a vicious cycle: spend more on compute to win the leaderboard, then spend even more to keep those high-cost models running at scale. OpenAI is already reportedly spending more on compute than it had previously let on. As TechCrunch reported recently, most of OpenAI’s inference spend — the money it spends on compute to run a trained AI model — is being paid in cash rather than through cloud credits, suggesting the company’s compute costs have grown beyond what partnerships and credits can subsidize. During the call, Simo suggested that as OpenAI scales, it is able to offer more products and services to generate more revenue to pay for additional compute. “But I think it’s important to place that in the grand arc of efficiency,” Simo said. “You are getting, today, a lot more intelligence for the same amount of compute and the same amount of dollars as you were a year ago.” For all its focus on reasoning, one thing that’s absent from today’s launch is a new image generator. Altman reportedly said in his code red memo that image generation would be a key priority moving forward, particularly after Google’s Nano Banana (the nickname for Google’s Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model) had a viral moment following its August release. Last month, Google launched Nano Banana Pro (aka Gemini 3 Pro Image), an upgraded version with even better text rendering, world knowledge, and an eerie, real-life, unedited vibe to its photos. It also integrates better across Google’s products, as demonstrated over the past week as it pops up in tools and workflows like Google Labs Mixboard for automated presentation generation. OpenAI reportedly plans to release another new model in January with better images, improved speed, and better personality, though the company didn’t confirm these plans Thursday. OpenAI also said Thursday it’s rolling out new safety measures around mental health use and age verification for teens, but didn’t spend much of the launch pitching those changes.

"Google debuts ‘Disco,’ a Gemini-powered tool for making web apps from browser tabs",https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/google-debuts-disco-a-gemini-powered-tool-for-making-web-apps-from-browser-tabs/,"Google on Thursday introduced a new AI experiment for the web browser: the Gemini-powered product Disco, which helps to turn your open tabs into custom applications. With Disco, you can create what Google is calling “GenTabs,” a tool that proactively suggests interactive web apps that can help you complete tasks related to what you’re browsing and allows you to build your own apps via written prompts. For instance, if you’re studying a particular subject, GenTabs might suggest building a web app to visualize the information, which could help you better understand the core principles. Or, in a less academic scenario, you could use GenTabs to help you create a meal plan from a series of online recipes or help you plan a trip when you’re researching travel. These are things that you can already do today with some AI-powered chatbots, but GenTabs builds these custom experiences on the fly using Gemini 3, using the information in your browser and in your Gemini chat history. After the app is built, you can also continue to refine it using natural language commands. The resulting generative elements in the GenTabs experience will link back to the original sources, Google notes. Like others in the AI market, Google has been experimenting with bringing AI deeper into the web-browsing experience. Instead of building its own stand-alone AI browser, like Perplexity’s Comet or ChatGPT Atlas, Google integrated its AI assistant Gemini into the Chrome browser, where it can optionally be used to ask questions about the web page you’re on. With GenTabs, the focus is not only on what you’re currently viewing, but also on your overall browsing, spanning multiple tabs — whether that’s research, learning, or something else. However, the feature is only initially going to be available to a small number of testers through Google Labs, who will offer feedback about the experience. The company says that interesting ideas that are developed through Disco may one day find their way into other, larger Google products. It also suggests that GenTabs will be one of many Disco features to come over time, noting that GenTabs is the “first feature” being tested. To access Disco, users will need to join a waitlist to download the app, starting on macOS."
"Runway releases its first world model, adds native audio to latest video model",https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/runway-releases-its-first-world-model-adds-native-audio-to-latest-video-model/,"The race to release world models is on as AI image and video generation company Runway joins an increasing number of startups and Big Tech companies by launching its first one. Dubbed GWM-1, the model works through frame-by-frame prediction, creating a simulation with an understanding of physics and how the world actually behaves over time, the company said. A world model is an AI system that learns an internal simulation of how the world works so it can reason, plan, and act without needing to be trained on every scenario possible in real life. Runway, which earlier this month launched its Gen 4.5 video model that surpassed both Google and OpenAI on the Video Arena leaderboard, said its GWM-1 world model is more “general” than Google’s Genie-3 and other competitors. The firm is pitching it as a model that can create simulations to train agents in different domains like robotics and life sciences. “To build a world model, we first needed to build a really great video model. We believe that the right path to building a world model is teaching models to predict pixels directly is the best way to achieve general-purpose simulation. At sufficient scale and with the right data, you can build a model that has sufficient understanding of how the world works,” the company’s CTO, Anastasis Germanidis, said during the livestream. Runway released specific slants or versions to the new world model called GWM-Worlds, GWM-Robotics, and GWM-Avatars. GWM-Worlds is an app for the model that lets you create an interactive project. Users can set a scene through a prompt or an image reference, and as you explore the space, the model generates the world with an understanding of geometry, physics, and lighting. The company mentioned that the simulation runs at 24 fps and 720p resolution. Runway said that while Worlds could be useful for gaming, it’s also well-positioned to teach agents how to navigate and behave in the physical world. With GWM-Robotics, the company aims to use synthetic data enriched with new parameters like changing  weather conditions or obstacles. Runway says this method could also reveal when and how robots might violate policies and instructions in different scenarios. Runway is also building realistic avatars under GWM-Avatars to simulate human behavior. Companies like D-ID, Synthesia, Soul Machines, and even Google have worked on creating human avatars that look real and work in areas like communication and training. The company noted that technically Worlds, Robotics, and Avatars are separate models, but eventually it plans to merge all these into one model. Besides releasing a new world model, the company is also updating its foundational Gen 4.5 model released earlier in the month. The new update brings native audio and long-form, multi-shot generation capabilities to the model. The company said that with this model, users can generate one-minute videos with character consistency, native dialogue, background audio, and complex shots from various angles. The company said that you can also edit existing audio and add dialogues. Plus, you can edit multi-shot videos of any length. The Gen 4.5 update nudges Runway closer to competitor Kling’s all-in-one video suite, which also launched earlier this month, particularly around native audio and multi-shot storytelling. It also signals that video generation models are moving from prototype to production-ready tools. Runway’s updated Gen 4.5 model is available to all paid plan users. The company said that it will make GWM-Robotics available through an SDK. It added that it is in active conversation with several robotics firms and enterprises for the use of GWM-Robotics and GWM-Avatars."
Disney signs deal with OpenAI to allow Sora to generate AI videos featuring its characters,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/disney-signs-deal-with-openai-to-allow-sora-to-generate-ai-videos-featuring-its-characters/,"The Walt Disney Company announced on Thursday that it has signed a three-year partnership with OpenAI that will bring its iconic characters to the company’s Sora AI video generator. Disney is also making a $1 billion equity investment in OpenAI. Disney CEO Bob Iger told CNBC that the deal comes with about a year of exclusivity. After the year is up, Disney can license its IP to other AI companies. Launched in September, Sora allows users to create short videos using simple prompts. With this new agreement, users will be able to draw on more than 200 animated, masked, and creature characters from Disney, Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars, including costumes, props, vehicles, and more. These characters include iconic faces like Mickey Mouse, Ariel, Belle, Cinderella, Baymax, and Simba, as well as characters from Encanto, Frozen, Inside Out, Moana, Monsters, Inc., Toy Story, Up, and Zootopia. Users will also be able to draw on animated or illustrated versions of Marvel and Lucasfilm characters like Black Panther, Captain America, Deadpool, Groot, Iron Man, Darth Vader, Han Solo, Stormtroopers, and more. Users will also be able to draw on these characters while using ChatGPT Images, the feature in ChatGPT that allows users to create visuals using text prompts. The agreement does not include any talent likenesses or voices, Disney says. “The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence marks an important moment for our industry, and through this collaboration with OpenAI we will thoughtfully and responsibly extend the reach of our storytelling through generative AI, while respecting and protecting creators and their works,” said Disney CEO Bob Iger in a statement. Disney says that alongside the agreement, it will “become a major customer of OpenAI,” as it will use its APIs to build new products, tools, and experiences, including for Disney+. “Disney is the global gold standard for storytelling, and we’re excited to partner to allow Sora and ChatGPT Images to expand the way people create and experience great content,” said Sam Altman, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, in a statement. “This agreement shows how AI companies and creative leaders can work together responsibly to promote innovation that benefits society, respect the importance of creativity, and help works reach vast new audiences.” It’s worth noting that Disney has sued the generative AI platform Midjourney for ignoring requests to stop violating its intellectual property rights. Disney also sent a cease-and-desist letter to Character.AI, urging the chatbot company to remove Disney characters from among the millions of AI companions on its platform. Disney’s agreement with OpenAI indicates the company isn’t fully closing the door on AI platforms."
TIME names ‘Architects of AI’ its Person of the Year,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/time-names-architects-of-ai-its-person-of-the-year/,"Each December, TIME Magazine names a person of the year — someone who has most influenced the news and world, for good or ill. Last year, TIME chose President Donald Trump for the second time. The year before that, it was Taylor Swift, who many claimed saved the economy from a recession with her Eras Tour. In 1938, the magazine chose Adolf Hitler.  This year, TIME has chosen to bestow its award on not just one person, but a group of people: the so-called “Architects of AI,” comprising the CEOs shaping the global AI race from the U.S. With AI on everyone’s minds, embodying hope for a small minority and economic anxiety for a majority, per recent Edelman data, this tracks. “For decades, humankind steeled itself for the rise of thinking machines,” the article reads. “Leaders striving to develop the technology, including Sam Altman and Elon Musk, warned that the pursuit of its powers could create unforeseen catastrophe […] This year, the debate about how to wield AI responsibly gave way to a sprint to deploy it as fast as possible.” Based on one of TIME’s two cover photos, some of those people appear to be Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, Tesla’s Elon Musk, OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, AMD’s Lisa Su, Anthropic’s Dario Amodei, Google DeepMind’s Demis Hassabis, and World Labs’ Fei-Fei Li — all individuals who raced “both beside and against each other.”  TIME writes that these individuals, through their multibillion-dollar bets on “one of the biggest physical infrastructure projects of all time,” have reshaped government policy, turned up the heat on geopolitical competition, and pushed AI adoption forward.  This is the story of how AI changed our world in 2025, in new and exciting and sometimes frightening ways. It is the story of how Huang and other tech titans grabbed the wheel of history, developing technology and making decisions that are reshaping the information landscape, the climate, and our livelihoods… AI emerged as arguably the most consequential tool in great-power competition since the advent of nuclear weapons. TIME only announced the news on Thursday morning, but images of the cover photo were leaked on prediction market Polymarket on Wednesday evening.

Opera wants you to pay $20 a month to use its AI-powered browser Neon,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/opera-wants-you-to-pay-20-a-month-to-use-its-ai-powered-browser-neon/,"Following a couple of months’ testing, Norway-based browser company Opera has finally made its AI-powered browser, Neon, available to the public — though you’ll have to shell out $19.90 per month to use it. Opera first unveiled Neon earlier this year in May and launched it in early access to select users in October. Similar to other AI-first browsers like Perplexity’s Comet, OpenAI’s Atlas, and The Browser Company’s Dia, Neon bakes in an AI chatbot into its interface, letting you ask it answers about pages, use it to create mini apps and videos, and get it to do tasks for you. The browser uses your browsing history as context, so you can do things like ask it to fetch details from a YouTube video you watched last week or the post that you read yesterday. You can also build “Cards” for repeatable tasks using prompts, and the browser offers a deep research agent that can get you detailed information about any topic. The browser also has a new tab organizational feature called Tasks, which are contained workspaces of AI chats and tabs. This feature is more like Tab Groups combined with Arc Browser’s Spaces feature, which has its own context for AI. In addition to the AI features, the subscription gives users access to top models like Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-5.1, Veo 3.1, and Nano Banana Pro. Subscribers will also get access to Opera’s Discord community and direct access to its developers. “Opera Neon is a product for people who like to be the first to the newest AI tech. It’s a rapidly evolving project with significant updates released every week. We’ve been shaping it with our Founders community for a while and are now excited to share the early access to it with a larger audience,” Krystian Kolondra, EVP of browsers at Opera, said in a statement. The company noted that its other products, like Opera One, Opera GX, and Opera Air, also have free AI features, like a chat-based assistant. Meanwhile, browser incumbents are taking a slower approach to adding AI features to their products. Earlier this week, Google detailed the security work it is doing to protect users against different attack surfaces that agentic features are prone to, and Brave said on Wednesday it is previewing its agentic features in a nightly build, and provides an isolated browsing profile for using AI features so users can keep their regular, non-AI usage separate."
Interest in Spoor’s bird-monitoring AI software is soaring,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/interest-in-spoors-bird-monitoring-ai-software-is-soaring/,"Spoor launched in 2021 with the goal of using computer vision to help reduce the impact of wind turbines on local bird populations. Now the startup has proven its technology works and is seeing demand from wind farms and beyond. Oslo, Norway-based Spoor has built software that uses computer vision to track and identify bird populations and migration patterns. The software can detect birds within a 2.5-kilometer radius (about 1.5 miles) and can work with any off-the-shelf high-resolution camera. Wind farm operators can use this information to better plan where wind farms should be located and to help them better navigate migration patterns. For example, a wind farm could slow down its turbines, or even stop them entirely, during heavy periods of local migration. Ask Helseth (pictured above left), the co-founder and CEO of Spoor, told TechCrunch last year that he got interested in this space after learning that wind farms lacked effective tracking methods, despite many countries having strict rules around where wind farms can be built and how they can operate due to local bird populations. “The expectations from the regulators are growing but the industry doesn’t have a great tool,” Helseth said at the time. “A lot of people [go out] in the field with binoculars and trained dogs to find out how many birds are colliding with the turbines.” Helseth told TechCrunch last week that since then, the company has proven the need for this technology and worked to make it better. At the time of its seed raise in 2024, Spoor was able to track birds in a 1-kilometer range, which has since doubled. As the company has collected more data to feed into its AI model, it has been able to improve its bird identification accuracy to about 96%. “Identifying the species of the bird for some of the clients, you add another layer,” Helseth said. “Is it a bird or not a bird? We have an in-house ornithologist to help train the model to train the new types of birds or a new type of species. Having deployment in other countries [means] having rare species in the database.” Spoor now works across three continents and with more than 20 of the world’s largest energy companies. It has also started to see interest from other industries such as airports and aquaculture farms. Spoor has a partnership with Rio Tinto, a London-based mining giant, to track bats. The company has also received interest in using its tech to track other objects of similar size — but Helseth said they aren’t thinking of pivoting into those areas quite yet. “Drones are of course a plastic bird in our mind,” Helseth joked. “They move in a different way and have a different shape and size. Currently we are discarding that data but we are getting interest in it.” Spoor recently raised an €8 million ($9.3 million) Series A round led by SET Ventures with participation from Ørsted Ventures, EnBW New Ventures, and Superorganism in addition to strategic investors. Helseth predicts that interest in this type of technology will only grow as regulators continue to crack down on wind farms. For example, French regulators shut down a wind farm in April due to its impact on the local bird population and imposed hundreds of millions of fines. “Our mission is to enable industry and nature to coexist,” Helseth said. “We have started on that journey, but we are still a small startup with a lot to prove. In the coming years, we want to really cement our position in the wind industry and become a global leader to tackle these challenges. At the same time, we want to build some proof points that this technology has value beyond that main category.”"
Port raises $100M at $800M valuation to take on Spotify’s Backstage,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/port-raises-100m-at-800m-valuation-to-take-on-spotifys-backstage/,"Spotify may be synonymous with music streaming, but it’s also got a wildly popular developer-tool side hustle called Backstage.   Backstage is an open source project that helps companies build their own internal developer portals: a catalog of their developer tools along with quick visualizations of the work the tools have done, and other metrics. But like many open source projects, Backstage is a build-it-yourself option.   Israeli startup Port has been gaining big-name customers like GitHub, British Telecom, and LG with a proprietary Backstage competitor: a dev tool portal that’s also now been geared to manage AI agents.   On Thursday, Port, founded in 2022, said it raised a fresh $100 million Series C round led by General Atlantic, with participation from Accel, Bessemer Venture Partners, and Team8. The round values Port at $800 million and brings its total funding to date to $158 million. This Series C follows the company’s $35 million Series B led by Accel and Bessemer, announced in May.  Of all the industries that LLM-based tech has infiltrated, coding is where it has the deepest roots. So, not surprisingly, developers are also on the cutting edge of building and adopting agents that can automate entire repeated processes — work far beyond asking AI to write some code.  But the problem here, according to Port co-founder and CEO Zohar Einy, it’s the Wild West right now for such dev tool agents at companies: finding them, sharing them, ensuring their work follows company standards, and so on. Developers “want to take AI beyond just coding. They want it to resolve incidents, resolve security issues. They want it to take care of the release management,” Einy told TechCrunch.  But if agents are connected to all kinds of different tools and data sources, if the data is scattered among them, if they have no way to collaborate, and have no corporate standards and guardrails, “it creates chaos,” his product pitch goes.  Port therefore offers more than just a catalog of dev and agent tools (although it does offer those). It supplies a layer of orchestration with features that measure agent performance and add a human in the loop, as desired, to approval processes.   A feature called “context lake” defines the data sources, context memory, and guardrails for agents. “It’s where you manage what agents ‘need to know’ to do their job safely and correctly,” Einy explained.  In addition to using Port to catalog agents devs have already created using other tools, they can use Port to create new agents. Plus, Port also offers a few of its own ready-made agents, which can do things like resolving help desk tickets and dealing with provisioning.  Einy describes his product as handling the other 90% of what software programmers do that isn’t writing code. “It gives the engineers a user interface to control the agent, to iterate with the agent, to approve what it does that is not coding, that is all the 90%.”  With its giant new war chest of cash, big name customers and tier-one VCs, Port looks like an agentic management startup to watch. But to say it faces competition is an understatement. The entire category of agentic management and orchestration is flooded with hopefuls, from Big Tech companies to startups, and they’re all coming at the various new problems in the space from different angles. A few of these include LangChain, UiPath, Cortex, and more.  "
Harness hits $5.5B valuation with $240M raise to automate AI’s ‘after-code’ gap,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/11/harness-hits-5-5b-valuation-with-240m-to-automate-ais-after-code-gap/,"AI DevOps tool Harness, founded in 2017 by serial entrepreneur Jyoti Bansal, is on track to exceed $250 million in annual recurring revenue in 2025, Bansal tells TechCrunch. The startup just raised a fresh $240 million Series E funding round that values the company at $5.5 billion post-money. The round includes a $200 million primary investment led by Goldman Sachs and a planned $40 million tender offer with participation from IVP, Menlo Ventures, and Unusual Ventures. The tender offer is intended to provide some liquidity to its long-term employees, Bansal said. The new valuation is a 49% jump from its $3.7 billion valuation in a $230 million round in April 2022. With this funding, the startup has raised $570 million of equity to date. As AI accelerates code production, it is widening a bottleneck in the far larger “after-code” phase of software development — the testing, security checks, and deployment work that still consumes nearly 70% of engineering time. Harness’s tools help automate this sprawling, error-prone layer, even as enterprises grapple with rising AI code volume and the risks of shipping even a single line of faulty software into production systems. Bansal is well known among developers for building and selling app performance company AppDynamics to Cisco for $3.7 billion in 2017. So the post-coding world is an area Bansal knows well. Harness uses AI agents to automate functions like testing, verification, security, and governance. It is built on a software delivery knowledge graph that maps code changes, services, deployments, tests, environments, incidents, policies, and costs. The knowledge graph helps differentiate Harness from other AI platforms, Bansal said, because it gives the system a deep understanding of each customer’s software delivery processes and architecture. “This knowledge graph is the context that our AI agents use,” he told TechCrunch. The purpose-built agents draw on that context to generate pipelines that match each customer’s specific policies, architecture, and operational requirements. Harness also uses an orchestration engine that turns the AI’s recommendations into automated actions, with checks in place to make sure those changes are applied safely. As AI is not foolproof, Bansal said the system is designed with human oversight, noting that AI-generated tests or fixes are reviewed by engineers, compliance teams, or auditors before being put into use. Microsoft’s GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins, and CloudBees are among the key competitors for Harness. But Harness has plenty of traction, claiming more than 1,000 enterprise customers, including United Airlines, Morningstar, Keller Williams, and National Australia Bank. So far, the startup has handled 128 million deployments, 81 million builds, protected 1.2 trillion API calls, and helped customers optimize $1.9 billion in cloud spending over the past year, Bansal touts. The San Francisco–based company employs over 1,200 people across 14 offices worldwide, including in Europe and the U.K. Around 33% of its workforce is in India, where it has a large engineering team in Bengaluru and a corporate office in Gurugram. Moreover, the Bengaluru site is Harness’s biggest development center outside the U.S. Harness plans to use the new funding to expand its R&D efforts, hire “hundreds of engineers” at its Bengaluru office, and build out additional automated testing, deployment, and security capabilities while improving the accuracy of its AI systems. The company also intends to strengthen its U.S. go-to-market operations and significantly expand its presence in international markets. It should also be noted that earlier this year, Bansal merged his software observability firm Traceable with Harness, and that move has helped the startup grow its ARR projection. “We brought the two companies together because we started to see that DevOps and application security are coming together in a very, very deep way,” said Bansal. “We have seen that turned out to be a very, very successful thesis this year … that’s driving a lot of growth for both of our DevOps and application security set of products.” While this raise has allowed some employees to cash out a bit,  Bansal still plans on taking Harness public one day, he said, though he did not share a specific timeline. “That’s what our goals and plans depend on,” he said of an eventual IPO. “Our business is very, very healthy, very strong, high growth and margins, and it will be a great public company when the timing is right.”"
Baby delivered in Waymo continues proud tradition of not making it to the hospital,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/baby-delivered-in-waymo-continues-proud-tradition-of-not-making-it-to-the-hospital/,"A pregnant woman in San Francisco gave birth inside a Waymo robotaxi Monday night en route to UCSF Medical Center, marking the latest milestone in the driverless car saga that no one saw coming — except everyone with more than six months of experience behind the wheel of a ride-share vehicle. According to The SF Standard, Waymo’s remote team detected “unusual activity” and called 911, though the vehicle beat emergency services to the hospital. Some traditions, it seems, are immune to disruption. For decades, expectant mothers have been racing against biology in the back seats of taxis and Ubers from London to Los Angeles. There was the mother in India who named her son Uber after giving birth to him en route to the hospital (the driver reportedly helped in the delivery). There was also the California couple in 2017 who welcomed their baby in an Uber during Shabbat. “Everyone is telling us to name the baby Uber,” the father joked, before adding, “But we can’t do that.” (Ah, though, they could have!) The stories go on and on. Now, Silicon Valley has automated the experience, at least partially. The vehicle in San Francisco was promptly removed for cleaning. Further, this wasn’t Waymo’s first birth — the company told the Standard that a Phoenix baby got there first. “While this is a very rare occurrence,” a Waymo spokesperson deadpanned, “some of our newest riders just can’t wait to experience their first Waymo ride.”"
Google’s answer to the AI arms race — promote the guy behind its data center tech,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/googles-answer-to-the-ai-arms-race-promote-the-guy-behind-its-data-center-tech/,"Google just made a major move in the AI infrastructure arms race, elevating Amin Vahdat to chief technologist for AI infrastructure, a newly created position reporting directly to CEO Sundar Pichai, according to a memo first reported by Semafor and later confirmed by TechCrunch. It’s a signal of just how critical this work has become as Google pours up to $93 billion into capital expenditures by the end of 2025 — a number that parent company Alphabet expects will be a whole lot bigger next year. Vahdat isn’t new to the game. The computer scientist, who holds a PhD from UC Berkeley and started as a research intern at Xerox PARC back in the early ’90s, has been quietly building Google’s AI backbone for the past 15 years. Before joining Google in 2010 as an engineering fellow and VP, he was an associate professor at Duke University and later a professor and SAIC Chair at UC San Diego. His academic credentials are formidable — with what appears to be around 395 published papers — and his research has always focused on making computers work more efficiently at massive scale. Vahdat already maintains a high profile with Google. Just eight months ago, at Google Cloud Next, he took the stage to unveil the company’s seventh-generation TPU, called Ironwood, in his role as VP and GM of ML, Systems, and Cloud AI. The specs he rattled off at the event were staggering, too: over 9,000 chips per pod delivering 42.5 exaflops of compute — more than 24 times the power of the world’s No. 1 supercomputer at the time, he said. “Demand for AI compute has increased by a factor of 100 million in just eight years,” he told the audience. Behind the scenes, as noted by Semafor, Vahdat has been orchestrating the unglamorous and essential work that keeps Google competitive, including those custom TPU chips for AI training and inference that give Google an edge over rivals like OpenAI, as well as the Jupiter network, the super-fast internal network that allows all its servers to talk to each other and move massive amounts of data around. (In a blog post late last year, Vahdat said that Jupiter now scales to 13 petabits per second, explaining that’s enough bandwidth to theoretically support a video call for all 8 billion people on Earth simultaneously.) Vahdat has also been deeply involved in the ongoing development of the Borg software system, Google’s cluster management system that acts as the brain coordinating all the work happening across its data centers. And he has said he oversaw the development of Axion, Google’s first custom Arm-based general-purpose CPUs designed for data centers, which the company unveiled last year and continues to build. In short, Vahdat is central to Google’s AI story. Indeed, in a market where top AI talent commands astronomical compensation and constant recruitment, Google’s decision to elevate Vahdat to the C-suite may also be about retention. When you’ve spent 15 years building someone into a linchpin of your AI strategy, you make sure they stay."
"State attorneys general warn Microsoft, OpenAI, Google, and other AI giants to fix ‘delusional’ outputs",https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/state-attorneys-general-warn-microsoft-openai-google-and-other-ai-giants-to-fix-delusional-outputs/,"After a string of disturbing mental health incidents involving AI chatbots, a group of state attorneys general have sent a letter to the AI industry’s top companies, with a warning to fix “delusional outputs” or risk being in breach of state law.  The letter, signed by dozens of AGs from U.S. states and territories with the National Association of Attorneys General, asks the companies, including Microsoft, OpenAI, Google, and 10 other major AI firms, to implement a variety of new internal safeguards to protect their users. Anthropic, Apple, Chai AI, Character Technologies, Luka, Meta, Nomi AI, Perplexity AI, Replika, and xAI were also included in the letter. The letter comes as a fight over AI regulations has been brewing between state and federal government. Those safeguards include transparent third-party audits of large language models that look for signs of delusional or sycophantic ideations, as well as new incident reporting procedures designed to notify users when chatbots produce psychologically harmful outputs. Those third parties, which could include academic and civil society groups, should be allowed to “evaluate systems pre-release without retaliation and to publish their findings without prior approval from the company,” the letter states. “GenAI has the potential to change how the world works in a positive way. But it also has caused—and has the potential to cause—serious harm, especially to vulnerable populations,” the letter states, pointing to a number of well-publicized incidents over the past year — including suicides and murder — in which violence has been linked to excessive AI use, the letter states. “In many of these incidents, the GenAI products generated sycophantic and delusional outputs that either encouraged users’ delusions or assured users that they were not delusional.” AGs also suggest companies treat mental health incidents the same way tech companies handle cybersecurity incidents — with clear and transparent incident reporting policies and procedures. Companies should develop and publish “detection and response timelines for sycophantic and delusional outputs,” the letter states. In a similar fashion to how data breaches are currently handled, companies should also “promptly, clearly, and directly notify users if they were exposed to potentially harmful sycophantic or delusional outputs,” the letter says.  Another ask is that the companies develop “reasonable and appropriate safety tests” on GenAI models to “ensure the models do not produce potentially harmful sycophantic and delusional outputs.” These tests should be conducted before the models are ever offered to the public, it adds.   TechCrunch was unable to reach Google, Microsoft, or OpenAI for comment prior to publication. The article will be updated if the companies respond. Tech companies developing AI have had a much warmer reception at the federal level. The Trump administration has made it known it is unabashedly pro-AI, and, over the past year, multiple attempts have been made to pass a nationwide moratorium on state-level AI regulations. So far, those attempts have failed — thanks, in part, to pressure from state officials. Not to be deterred, Trump announced Monday he plans to pass an executive order next week that will limit the ability of states to regulate AI. The president said in a post on Truth Social he hoped his EO would stop AI from being “DESTROYED IN ITS INFANCY.” "
Nvidia is reportedly testing tracking software as chip-smuggling rumors swirl,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/nvidia-is-reportedly-testing-tracking-software-as-chip-smuggling-rumors-swirl/,"Nvidia is allegedly testing software that can track the location of its AI chips as reports of its chips being smuggled into China are on the rise. Nvidia has built location verification technology that would allow it to track which country a chip is located in, Reuters originally reported, citing anonymous sources. This software tracks computing performance but the delay in communication between servers also offers a sense of a chip’s location. This software will be optional for customers to use and will be made available for Blackwell chips first, Reuters said. Multiple reports have surfaced in the last few days that allege China’s DeepSeek AI models have been trained on smuggled Nvidia Blackwell chips. Nvidia responded to these reports by saying it hasn’t seen evidence of this type of smuggling. “We haven’t seen any substantiation or received tips of ‘phantom data centers’ constructed to deceive us and our OEM partners, then deconstructed, smuggled, and reconstructed somewhere else. While such smuggling seems far-fetched, we pursue any tip we receive,” an Nvidia spokesperson told TechCrunch. This news comes just days after Nvidia got the green light from the U.S. government to start selling its H200 AI chips to approved customers in China on Monday. That announcement pertains only to older H200 chips and not the company’s Blackwell chips."
"Spotify tests more personalized, AI-powered ‘Prompted Playlists’",https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/spotify-tests-more-personalized-ai-powered-prompted-playlists/,"Spotify announced on Wednesday that, for the first time, it’s giving users more control over the streaming service’s algorithm. That’s at least how the company is framing the launch of its new “Promoted Playlists,” a feature that will initially be available to Premium subscribers in New Zealand. The feature, which is currently available in English only, is still in beta and will evolve before rolling out to other markets, according to Spotify. The new tool allows users to describe what they want to hear in a personalized playlist that reflects the “full arc” of their tastes, according to the company. That means the playlist focuses not only on the songs you like now, but your entire Spotify listening history from day one — something that differentiates the feature from other playlists, the company says. The feature is an evolution from Spotify’s existing AI playlist option, which debuted last year, and also works through written prompts. As with AI playlists, the new Prompted Playlists allow users to request what they want to hear with written instructions. However, they can now write much longer prompts with more specific instructions. That’s because the new AI feature factors in world knowledge, a rep from Spotify explained to TechCrunch. In addition, the ability to go further back in your listening history and schedule how often the playlist refreshes makes it different from Spotify’s other AI playlist offerings. For instance, Spotify suggests subscribers can use the new feature to ask for something like, “music from my top artists from the last five years,” then amend the prompt to include a request for “deep cuts I haven’t heard yet.” In another example of a longer prompt, Spotify said you could ask for “high-energy pop and hip-hop for a 30-minute 5K run that keeps a steady pace before easing into relaxing songs for a cool-down” or “music from this year’s biggest films and most-talked-about TV shows that match my taste.” In addition, you can continue to fine-tune the prompt to make it even more specific, and can set how often you want it to refresh, like daily or weekly. The idea is that users can essentially make their own version of something like Spotify’s flagship playlist, Discover Weekly, but one that’s focused on a type of music, genre, or time period they’d like to track, or their own version of something like Spotify’s genre-focused Daily Mixes. The company says the playlist will include descriptions and context so you know why you’re getting the recommendation. Plus, it will offer a set of prompts to help users get started. Spotify isn’t the only social app pitching how it’s letting users take control of its algorithm. Instagram today also introduced a new feature that lets users control what type of reels they see. Bluesky, a decentralized X competitor, also lets users swap out its algorithm for one of their own."
Google is testing AI-powered article overviews on select publications’ Google News pages,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/google-is-testing-ai-powered-article-overviews-on-select-publications-google-news-pages/,"Google is testing AI-powered article overviews on participating publications’ Google News pages as part of a new pilot program, the search giant announced on Wednesday. News publishers participating in the pilot program include Der Spiegel, El País, Folha, Infobae, Kompas, The Guardian, The Times of India, The Washington Examiner, and The Washington Post, among others. The purpose of the new commercial partnership program is to “explore how AI can drive more engaged audiences,” Google said in a blog post. As part of the new AI pilot program, the company will work with publishers to experiment with new features in Google News. By adding AI-powered article overviews, Google says users will get more context before they click through to read an article. While AI-generated summaries may lead to fewer clicks on news articles, publications participating in the commercial pilot program will receive direct payments from Google, which could make up for the potential decrease in traffic to their sites. The AI-powered article overviews will only appear on participating publications’ Google News pages, and not anywhere else on Google News or in Search. This isn’t the first time that Google has introduced AI summaries for news. In July, the company rolled out AI summaries in Discover, the main news feed inside Google’s search app. With this change, users no longer see a single headline from a major publication in the feed. Instead, they see the logos of multiple news publishers in the top-left corner, followed by an AI-generated summary that cites those sources. Google is also experimenting with audio briefings for people who prefer listening to the news rather than reading it, as part of the new pilot program. The company says these features will include clear attribution and a link to articles. Additionally, Google is partnering with organizations such as Estadão, Antara, Yonhap, and The Associated Press to incorporate real-time information and enhance results in the Gemini app. “As the way people consume information evolves, we’ll continue to improve our products for people around the world and engage with feedback from stakeholders across the ecosystem,” Google wrote in its blog post. “We’re doing this work in collaboration with websites and creators of all sizes, from major news publishers to new and emerging voices.” As part of Google’s Wednesday announcement, the company said that it’s launching its “Preferred Sources” feature globally after first launching it in the U.S. and India in August. The feature allows users to select their favorite news sites and blogs to appear in the Top Stories section of Google search results. In the coming days, the feature will be available for English-language users worldwide, and Google plans to roll it out to all supported languages early next year. Google will now also highlight links from your news subscriptions and show these links in a dedicated carousel in the Gemini app in the coming weeks, with AI Overviews and AI Mode to follow. While these features make it easy for users to access news from their preferred sources, they also risk confining them to an ideological bubble that limits their exposure to different perspectives. Google also announced that it’s increasing the number of inline links in AI Mode. Additionally, it’s introducing “contextual introductions” for embedded links, which are brief explanations that explain why a link could be useful to explore."

ChatGPT is Apple’s most downloaded app of 2025 in the US,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/chatgpt-is-apples-most-downloaded-app-of-2025-in-the-us/,"Apple on Wednesday released its annual list of the most downloaded apps and games for the year. For the U.S. market, OpenAI’s ChatGPT topped the ranks of free iPhone apps (not including games) with the most installs in 2025. The AI app was followed by Threads, Google, TikTok, WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail, and Google’s Gemini. ChatGPT made it to No. 4 last year, but the top spot was taken by Chinese shopping app Temu. In 2023, the AI app didn’t make the top-10 list despite being released on the iPhone in May 2023 to a strong debut. The fact that ChatGPT is outpacing social networking standbys, and much-needed utilities like Google Maps, indicates how deeply AI has penetrated people’s everyday lives here in the U.S. It also demonstrates the potential for OpenAI to disrupt Google’s tight hold on the search market on mobile devices, as more people turn to a chatbot for answers first. There were signs that ChatGPT was on its way to No. 1 earlier in the year — it became the most-downloaded app globally in March, outpacing other top apps like TikTok and Instagram. Apple also released its list of the top paid apps, the top free and paid games for iPhone and iPad, as well as the top Apple Arcade games. Block Blast! was the top free game this year, while Minecraft took the crown as the top paid game. On iPad, YouTube was the No. 1 free app, and users downloaded the creativity app Procreate as the top paid game on iPad. Roblox was the top free iPad game. The full list of top apps and games is below:"
Google launches managed MCP servers that let AI agents simply plug into its tools,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/google-is-going-all-in-on-mcp-servers-agent-ready-by-design/,"AI agents are being sold as the solution for planning trips, answering business questions, and solving problems of all kinds, but getting them to work with tools and data outside their chat interfaces has been tricky. Developers have to patch together various connectors and keep them running, but that’s a fragile approach that’s hard to scale and creates governance headaches. Google claims it’s trying to solve that by launching its own fully managed, remote MCP servers that would make its Google and Cloud services — like Maps and BigQuery — easier for agents to plug into. The move follows the launch of Google’s latest Gemini 3 model, and the company is looking to pair stronger reasoning with more dependable connections to real-world tools and data. “We are making Google agent-ready by design,” Steren Giannini, product management director at Google Cloud, told TechCrunch.  Instead of spending a week or two setting up connectors, developers can now essentially paste in a URL to a managed endpoint, Giannini said. At launch, Google is starting with MCP servers for Maps, BigQuery, Compute Engine, and Kubernetes Engine. In practice, this might look like an analytics assistant querying BigQuery directly, or an ops agent interacting with infrastructure services.  In the case of Maps, Giannini said, without the MCP, developers would rely on the model’s built-in knowledge. “But by giving your agent […] a tool like the Google Maps MCP server, then it gets grounded on actual, up-to-date location information for places or trips planning,” he added. While the MCP servers will eventually be offered across all of Google’s tools, they are initially launching under public preview, meaning they’re not yet fully covered by Google Cloud terms of service. They are, however, being offered at no extra cost to enterprise customers that already pay for Google services.  “We expect to bring them to general availability very soon in the new year,” Giannini said, adding that he expects more MCP servers to trickle in every week. MCP, which stands for Model Context Protocol, was developed by Anthropic about a year ago as an open source standard to connect AI systems with data and tools. The protocol has been widely adopted across the agent tooling world, and Anthropic earlier this week donated MCP to a new Linux Foundation fund dedicated to open sourcing and standardizing AI agent infrastructure.  “The beauty of MCP is that, because it’s a standard, if Google provides a server, it can connect to any client,” Giannini said. “I’m looking forward to seeing how many more clients will emerge.” One can think of MCP clients as the AI apps on the other end of the wire that talk to MCP servers and call the tools they offer. For Google, that includes Gemini CLI and AI Studio. Giannini said he’s also tried it with Anthropic’s Claude and OpenAI’s ChatGPT as clients, and “they just work.” Google argues this isn’t just about connecting agents to its services. The bigger enterprise play is Apigee, its API management product, which many companies already use to issue API keys, set quotas, and monitor traffic.  Giannini said Apigee can essentially “translate” a standard API into an MCP server, turning endpoints like a product catalog API into tools an agent can discover and use, with existing security and governance controls layered on top.  In other words, the same API guardrails companies use for human-built apps could now apply to AI agents, too.  Google’s new MCP servers are protected by a permission mechanism called Google Cloud IAM, which explicitly protects what an agent can do with that server. They are also protected by Google Cloud Model Armor, which Giannini describes as a firewall dedicated to agentic workloads that defends against advanced agentic threats like prompt injection and data exfiltration. Administrators can also rely on audit logging for additional observability.  Google plans to expand MCP support beyond the initial set of servers. In the next few months, the company will roll out support for services across areas like storage, databases, logging and monitoring, and security. “We built the plumbing so that developers don’t have to,” Giannini said."
AI startup Tavus founder says users talk to its AI Santa ‘for hours’ per day,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/ai-startup-tavus-founder-says-users-talk-to-its-ai-santa-for-hours-per-day/,"A new helper has arrived at the North Pole in recent years: AI. Tavus, the AI startup that creates digital replicas using voice and face cloning technology, has launched its AI Santa experience for the second year in a row. This allows parents and children to video chat with a virtual version of the jolly old Saint Nick. After signing up for a free account, users can interact with AI Santa via text, phone, or video chat. Users can tell AI Santa what they want for Christmas, share their holiday plans, and find out if they’re on the naughty or nice list.  This year, the company debuted an improved version of AI Santa, designed to be more expressive and emotionally aware. Santa is now a “Tavus PAL,” the company’s name for its real-time AI agents that are built to see, hear, respond, and appear human. AI Santa can now see users’ expressions and gestures and respond to them. It also remembers users’ conversations and interests, creating a more personalized experience. Notably, it now can take actions of its own, including searching the web for present ideas or even perform everyday tasks like drafting emails. During testing, the conversation with AI Santa was engaging for the most part. When we mentioned wanting a new PlayStation for Christmas, Santa followed up with questions about our favorite video games, showing knowledge of specific titles like Baldur’s Gate 3. It also smiled back when we did. (We didn’t like that part very much, but maybe others will.) Users appear to be enjoying the improved experience so far. Founder and CEO Hassaan Raza said that many people are engaging with the platform frequently, spending hours chatting with AI Santa and often reaching their daily limits. “Last year’s AI Santa drew millions of hits, and we’re on pace to surpass that by a wide margin as Christmas approaches,” he noted. While this level of engagement marks a milestone for Tavus, it also raises questions about the impact of such interactions, especially for young children. Children may struggle to distinguish between AI and a real person. Spending hours in conversation with an AI has already been linked to negative effects in adults, making the potential effects on children who strongly believe in Santa a concern for some parents. During our testing, there were subtle cues that the AI Santa does yet appear fully human-like, such as long pauses and a flat voice. We also found that if a user were to question whether it’s real, the programmed response was: “I’m an AI Santa powered by Tavus’ magic and technology. I might not be the physical Santa, but I’ve got the spirit and the cheer.” Still, the experience launches amid growing concerns about AI’s effects on young users. There have been reports linking chatbot interactions to serious harm, including cases where chatbots were implicated in the suicide deaths of teenagers. Character.AI removed access to its chatbots for users under 18 in October.  Raza emphasized that the AI Santa experience is designed for families to enjoy together, with safety measures in place to ensure appropriate interactions. Safety features, such as content filters, have been implemented to maintain family-friendly discussions.  In certain situations, conversations can be terminated, and users are directed to mental health resources if necessary.  “The vast majority of interactions have been family-friendly and true to the Santa experience,” he said.  Additionally, when asked about data collection, Raza said the company “collects logs, session timestamps, metadata, and other information users choose to share during their chats. This data is used to provide and maintain a safe experience, and users can request data deletion at any point in time.” "
Figma launches new AI-powered object removal and image extension,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/figma-launches-new-ai-powered-object-removal-and-image-extension/,"Design tool Figma launched new AI-powered image-editing features today, including the ability to remove and isolate objects and expand images. The company said that these features will save the hassle of exporting images to other tools for editing and importing them back. It added that generation models like Nano Banana are good for creating images, but users often need granular tools for editing that work without any text prompts. Figma has improved its lasso tool for selection. Now you can use it to select an object, remove it, or isolate it to move it around. When you move around the object, the image still retains other characteristics, such as background and color. Users can also select an object to adjust factors like lighting, shadow, color, or focus. The company is also bringing an image-expansion feature to its design suite. This feature is handy when you are adjusting a creative for a particular format and need to fill in the background or other details. For instance, creating a web banner or mobile banner from a 1×1 image. It essentially saves you from constantly cropping an image and adjusting elements within it. Besides adding these features, Figma is collating all its image-editing tools in one toolbar for easier access. You can select objects or parts of images, change background color, and add annotations or text using this toolbar. The company said removing background is one of the most common actions on the platform, and that is why it is getting a prominent spot on the new toolbar. Rivals like Adobe and Canva have had object removal for a few years now. Figma is finally catching up to offer these features. The company said the new image-editing features are available on Figma Design and Draw, with plans to make them available across Figma tools next year. Figma’s launch comes on the same day as Adobe making some of these features available to users within ChatGPT. Figma was one of the launch partners of the app, calling on ChatGPT in October. It is not clear if these new functions will be available to users using Figma within OpenAI’s tool.  "
Google launches sub-$5 AI Plus plan in India to compete with ChatGPT Go,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/google-launches-sub-5-ai-plus-plan-in-india-to-compete-with-chatgpt-go/,"Google on Wednesday launched its more affordable AI Plus plan in India as it seeks to compete on pricing with other low-cost AI offerings, like OpenAI’s ChatGPT Go subscription. For new users in India, Google is offering AI Plus for ₹199 ($2.21) per month, for the first six months, after which you’ll have to pay ₹399 ($4.44) a month. The AI Plus plan gives users higher limits for Gemini 3 Pro and image editing model Nano Banana Pro; access to video generation in the Gemini and Flow apps; expanded access to deep research in NotebookLM; and 200GB of storage across Photos, Drive, and Gmail. Subscribers can give access to up to five family members, too. Before this, Google’s cheapest AI subscription available in the country was AI Pro, which was priced at ₹1,950 per month ($21.69). But Google is late to customize its pricing for India, as the AI Plus plan was first introduced in Indonesia in September and offered it in other countries that same month. OpenAI debuted its sub-$5 ChatGPT Go plan in India in August and made it available in other countries in subsequent months. The plan allows users to have 10 times more limits than the free plan for messages, image generation, and file uploads. AI companies have been busy offering freebies in India as they seek to tap its huge population for users. First, Perplexity partnered with telco Airtel to offer its Pro plan for a year to all Airtel customers for free. OpenAI also offered ChatGPT Go free for a year to existing subscribers of Go and new users. Meanwhile, Google teamed up with telco Reliance Jio to offer its AI Pro plan for 18 months at no cost to users on a certain carrier plan. "
CoreWeave CEO defends AI circular deals as ‘working together’,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/coreweave-ceo-defends-ai-circular-deals-as-working-together/,"It’s been quite the year for CoreWeave. In March, the AI cloud infrastructure provider went public in one of the biggest and most anticipated IPOs of the year that didn’t live up to its hype. Another setback took place in October, when a planned acquisition of the cloud provider’s business partner, Core Scientific, faltered due to skepticism from the acquisition target’s shareholders.  In the meantime, the firm has acquired a number of different companies, its stock has gone up and down, and it’s been both criticized and lauded for its role in the booming AI data center market.  In an interview at the Fortune Brainstorm AI summit in San Francisco on Tuesday, CoreWeave’s co-founder and CEO, Michael Intrator, defended his company’s performance from critics, noting that it was in the midst of creating a “new business model” for how cloud computing can be built and run. Their collection of Nvidia GPUs is so valuable, they borrow against it to help finance their business. The executive seemed to imply: If you’re charting a new path, you’re destined to encounter some road bumps along the way.   “I think people are myopic a lot of times,” Intrator said when questioned about his company’s occasionally unstable stock price. “Yes, it is seesawing,” he admitted, while noting that the CoreWeave IPO took place not long before President Trump’s tariffs went into effect — a notably uncertain moment for the overall economy.  “We came out into one of the most challenging environments, right around Liberation Day and, in spite of the incredible headwinds, were able to launch a successful IPO,” the CEO told Brainstorm editorial director Andrew Nusca. “I couldn’t be prouder of what the company has accomplished,” he added.  CoreWeave’s stock may have debuted amid the economic doldrums of March but its price has gone on quite the journey since then. It debuted at $40 and, over the past eight months, has climbed to well over $150, but currently rests at around $90. Its more wary critics have compared it to a meme stock due to its penchant for going up and down.  Some of the uncertainty around CoreWeave’s stock has been credited to the company’s hefty level of debt. Not long after CoreWeave announced a deal on Monday to issue even more debt to finance its data center buildout, its stock dropped some 8%. Intrator seems to see his company as a disruptor, one whose unconventional tactics may take some getting used to. “When you introduce a new model, when you introduce a new way of doing business, when you disrupt what has been a static environment, it’s going to take some people some time,” he said during his appearance Tuesday.  CoreWeave actually started its corporate life as a crypto miner but in short order built itself into a pivotal provider of “AI infrastructure” to some of the tech industry’s most major players. In that role, it provides GPUs to AI developers and has made major partnerships with Microsoft, OpenAI, Nvidia, Meta, and other tech titans.   Another topic broached Tuesday was the notion of “circularity” within the AI industry. “Circular” business deals, in which a small number of powerful AI companies invest in one another, have frequently been criticized and have raised questions about the industry’s long-term economic stability. Perhaps not surprisingly, since Nvidia is one of its investors and its supplier of GPUs, Intrator swatted away such concerns. “Companies are trying to address a violent change in supply and demand,” he said. “You do that by working together.” Since the IPO, CoreWeave has continued to make efforts to expand its business. After it acquired Weights & Biases, an AI developer platform, in March, it went on to acquire OpenPipe, a startup that helps companies create and deploy AI agents through reinforcement learning. In October, it also made deals to acquire Marimo (the creator of an open source notebook) and Monolith, another AI company. It also recently announced an expansion of its cloud partnership with OpenAI and said it has plans to move into the federal market, where it wants to provide cloud infrastructure to U.S. government agencies and the defense industrial base. "
Unconventional AI confirms its massive  $475M seed round,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/unconventional-ai-confirms-its-massive-475m-seed-round/,"Naveen Rao, the former head of AI at Databricks, has raised $475 million in seed capital at a $4.5 billion valuation for his new startup, Unconventional AI. The round was led by Andreessen Horowitz and Lightspeed Ventures, with participation from Lux Capital and DCVC. The funding is a first installment toward the goal of up to $1 billion for the round, Rao told Bloomberg. TechCrunch was first to report, back in October, that Unconventional AI was seeking this mega funding for Rao’s new startup, although the final valuation is marginally lower than the $5 billion sources told us he was seeking. If he does eventually raise as much as $1 billion, we’ll see how that impacts his company’s value. Unconventional AI is set on building a new, energy-efficient computer for AI. Rao previously wrote on X that his goal is to create a computer that is “as efficient as biology.” Databricks acquired Rao’s previous startup, MosaicML in 2023, for $1.3 billion. Prior to MosaicML, Rao co-founded the machine learning platform Nervana Systems, which Intel Corp. acquired in 2016 for reportedly more than $400 million. "
Cashew Research is going after the $90B market research industry with AI,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/cashew-research-is-going-after-the-90b-market-research-industry-with-ai/,"Market research is a $90 billion industry that helps brands figure out how to best present themselves to potential customers. But that market insight isn’t cheap, nor is it quick. Cashew Research wants to change that using AI. Calgary, Alberta-based Cashew uses AI to develop market research plans and surveys for brands based on what information they are looking for — like what their brand recognition is for a specific population or how a marketing tagline resonates with customers. Cashew then sends the survey to real people and uses AI to summarize and digest the findings. Cashew was one of the 200 startups chosen for TechCrunch’s Startup Battlefield competition in 2025 and won the Enterprise Stage pitch competition at TechCrunch Disrupt. “You can use an LLM to try to do deep research and get answers to your questions, or you could use a firm that’s going to be really expensive,” Addy Graves, co-founder and CEO of Cashew, told TechCrunch in describing the current market research industry. “Now there’s Cashew that exists in the middle. It creates custom, fresh data to answer your question instead of you just using an LLM that’s surfacing the same recycled pool of data that everybody’s finding on the internet.” Graves has more than a decade of market research experience. The original idea for Cashew was sparked by an issue she ran into frequently: Clients wanted full research projects — with real-world data from humans — done within a few days. For years, shortening that timeline while still producing the same quality of research results wasn’t possible, Graves said, because the technology to speed up the process wasn’t ready yet. “That was definitely the aha moment,” Graves said. “And it wasn’t until the onset of AI that we were actually able to automate these processes that we use as researchers, best practices, these data science-backed methodologies, as well as the formatting of reports that we know that everybody wants.” Bringing automation to the process also brings the cost down, which makes Cashew an option for small and medium-size brands that wouldn’t have been able to afford to work with a traditional market research firm, Graves added. Graves founded Cashew in 2023 alongside Rose Wong, chief operating officer, with an initial focus on consumer packaged goods, specifically food and beverage. Graves said she thinks Cashew can stand out in the increasingly crowded AI marketing tools category because it isn’t fully automated. Each Cashew client gets fresh human data with each project, which requires market research expertise, Graves said. Cashew’s competitive advantage may only grow as the company matures. The company takes all of the real-world data it collects from its clients’ projects, anonymizes it, and puts it in a database, which can help add additional proprietary data to future research projects, too. The company has raised C$1.5 million in pre-seed funding and is gearing up to launch its seed round in early 2026 with the hope of raising up to $5 million, Graves said. That capital will be put toward continuing to develop the product’s tech. Graves said the company’s two main areas of focus heading into next year are increasing the company’s presence in the U.S. and also working to build up its B2B business. “The people who are already buying research, that’s already a massive category, but that doesn’t even include all the people that could be buying research but just can’t afford it or can’t do it right now because they don’t have the timelines,” Graves said. “We’re actually creating this new category for marketers to gain access to answers to these questions that they’ve had.”"
Max Hodak is more worried about Twitter than brain-computer interface hacking,https://techcrunch.com/podcast/max-hodak-is-more-worried-about-twitter-than-brain-computer-interface-hacking/,"This week on StrictlyVC Download, Connie Loizos speaks with Science Corp. founder Max Hodak to discuss how brain-computer interfaces are arriving faster than anyone realizes.

B Capital founding partner Kabir Narang leaves to launch new investment platform,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/b-capital-founding-partner-kabir-narang-leaves-to-launch-new-investment-platform/,"Kabir Narang, a founding general partner at B Capital and an early backer of several Indian startups, has left the global venture firm, TechCrunch has learned and confirmed with the company. Narang is laying the groundwork for a new investment platform slated for 2026 that will focus on “compounding at the intersection of technology, AI, and global capital flows,” per a note shared with founders and reviewed by TechCrunch. After joining B Capital in March 2017, Narang co-led the firm’s Asia strategy from Singapore and chaired its global investment committee. During his tenure, he backed Indian startups such as Meesho, Khatabook, CredAvenue, Bounce, and Bizongo. “We are living through one of the most profound technological revolutions in history, and one of the toughest tests of investor discipline,” Narang wrote. “AI scales thought itself, compressing the gap between idea and output. The founders who pair that speed with pricing power and improving unit economics will define the next generation of enduring value.” Alongside developing the new investment platform, Narang told founders that he is taking 1% to 2% personal stakes in companies he believes can “compound intelligently.” This suggests he plans to stay active in early-stage investing while setting up a broader vehicle. B Capital confirmed Narang’s exit to TechCrunch and noted that Eduardo Saverin, Karan Mohla, and Howard Morgan would manage its Asia portfolio alongside the existing team in South and Southeast Asia. “After more than eight years with the firm, Kabir Narang, who focused on later stage growth investing efforts in Asia, has left his role to pursue other opportunities,” a B Capital spokesperson said. “We are grateful for his contributions, and we wish him continued success in the future.” Founded in 2015 by Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin and former Bain Capital executive Raj Ganguly, B Capital is a multi-stage investor focused on technology, healthcare, and resilience tech. The San Francisco–based firm manages more than $9 billion across nine offices in the U.S. and Asia. Through a partnership with Boston Consulting Group, B Capital also provides portfolio companies with strategic and operational support. Before joining B Capital, Narang spent nearly nine years at Fidelity-backed Eight Roads Ventures India, where he was a managing director. “B Capital remains deeply committed to our strategy in Asia and our broader global platform,” the B Capital spokesperson said. “With strong leadership and an experienced team across the region, we are well-positioned to capitalize on the next wave of innovation and continue backing category-defining companies across our core markets.” Narang did not respond to a request for comment.

"Why Cursor’s CEO believes OpenAI, Anthropic competition won’t crush his startup",https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/why-cursors-ceo-believes-openai-anthropic-competition-wont-crush-his-startup/,"Anysphere, the company that makes AI coding assistant darling Cursor, isn’t thinking about an IPO any time soon, its co-founder CEO Michael Truell said onstage Monday at Fortune’s AI Brainstorm conference. After reaching $1 billion in annualized revenue in November and raising $2.3 billion at a $29.3 billion valuation last month, Truell said his company is instead focused on building out more features. For instance, he noted that Cursor’s homegrown LLMs were geared to support specific products. Cursor also confirmed the existence of those models in November when it said in a blog post, “Our in-house models now generate more code than almost any other LLMs in the world.” His comments about the models came up at Fortune’s event when the founder was asked how he plans to compete with the LLM makers that he relies on when the major ones — OpenAI, Anthropic — have their own AI coding offerings. Truell likened their coding products to “a concept car,” whereas his product is a production automobile. “It would be like taking an engine and a concept car around it instead of a whole end-to-end car that was manufactured,” Truell said. “What we do is we take the best intelligence that the market has to offer from many different providers. And we also do our own product-specific models in places. We take that, we build it together and integrate it, then also build the best tool and end UX for working with AI.” Cursor’s dependence on its competitors — and its need to build its own LLMs — has been a subject of speculation among VCs in Silicon Valley since earlier this year when OpenAI reportedly looked at Anysphere as an acquisition target. Anysphere turned the idea down. (This was around the same time that Windsurf’s OpenAI deal also didn’t materialize, with the founder eventually joining Google.) The issue, investors told TechCrunch, was that AI coding editors were losing money thanks to high costs they paid to the model makers. In Cursor’s case, instead of selling, it adjusted pricing to a usage model in July, directly passing along the API fees that model makers charge to its users. This change from an all-inclusive subscription fee (and the surprise big bills some customers faced) caused an uproar among some of its users. On Monday, when asked about the pricing kerfuffle, Truell said, “When we started Cursor, you would turn to Cursor for a quick JavaScript question and now you’re turning to it to do hours of work for you. So the pricing model had to shift for us and others in the space. That means shifting more towards a consumption model,” he said. Truell added that one of the tools the company is working on is cloud-computing-like cost-management tools, which lets enterprises monitor their total usage and keep tabs on the bills their engineers are running up. “We have a whole team internally dedicated to enterprise engineering and building things like spend controls and billing groups and visibility,” he said. Additionally, he said Cursor is focused on two major areas for the next year. One is handling more complex agentic functions. “We want you to take end-to-end tasks, ones that are concise to specify but then are really hard to do, and have them entirely be done by Cursor. An example is a bug fix,” Truell explained. He particularly wants Cursor to be able to fix the kinds of bugs that might be easy to describe but take “weeks of someone’s time, thousands of times running the code” to handle. “We want Cursor to do that, end-to-end,” he said. The other area he named, but didn’t explain with much detail, was the idea of “thinking about teams as the atomic unit that we serve,” he said. This must be in contrast to serving individual coders, and a hint to how well its enterprise business is going. In addition to cost-monitoring features, Truell said he wants Cursor to handle more parts of the software development life cycle outside of writing code. He pointed to Cursor’s code review product as an example, which he said is being used by some customers to analyze every pull request, be it written by AI or human. (A pull request is when a programmer submits code for review before it is merged into the main project.) “So you’ll see us start to help teams more as a whole,” with more features like that, he promised. Meanwhile, big competitors are also all gearing up for the complex-task agentic world. Amazon just released a coding tool it promises can already run for days on end. Just this week, the AI power players, including Anthropic, OpenAI, Microsoft, AWS, and many others, launched a new consortium under the Linux Foundation to develop open source agentic interoperability standards. They even contributed some of their key projects, like Anthropic’s wildly popular Model Context Protocol (MCP). His plans for the year likely won’t put Anysphere firmly ahead of Cursor’s main model-maker competitors. They should, however, keep the company in the race.  "
Rivian is building its own AI assistant,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/rivian-is-building-its-own-ai-assistant/,"Rivian has spent nearly two years building its own AI assistant, an effort that remains separate from its multibillion-dollar technology joint venture with Volkswagen, TechCrunch has learned. Rivian hasn’t revealed when it will put the AI assistant in consumers hands. However, in an interview earlier this year, Rivian’s software chief Wassym Bensaid told TechCrunch it was targeting the end of the year. The company will likely share more during its upcoming AI & Autonomy Day, which will be livestreamed starting at 9 a.m. PT December 11. Rivian’s plans are reflective of the moment as the pace of development from foundational AI companies — the tech giants and startups like Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, Meta, and OpenAI that are building the core models and infrastructure — accelerates and industries scramble to keep up. But as Bensaid noted to TechCrunch earlier this year, this isn’t some slapdash effort to stay on trend. Nor is it simply a chatbot thrown into the infotainment system. The company has put considerable thought, resources, and time into the product, Bensaid said, noting that it’s designed to be integrated with all vehicle controls. The company started with an underlying philosophy to build an overall architecture that is model and platform agnostic, according to Bensaid. The Rivian AI assistant team, which is based out of the company’s Palo Alto office, soon realized effort and attention should also be directed toward developing the software layers that help coordinate various workflows as well as the control logic that resolves conflicts. “And that’s the in-vehicle platform we have built,” Bensaid said. “We use what the industry loves to now call an agentic framework; but we thought about that architecture since very early so that we can interface with different models.” The in-house AI assistant program is consistent with Rivian’s push to become more vertically integrated. In 2024, Rivian overhauled its flagship R1T truck and R1S SUV, changing everything from the battery pack and suspension system to the electrical architecture, sensor stack, and software user interface. The company has also put considerable resources toward developing and improving its own software stack, which includes everything related to real-time operating systems (RTOS) that manage the car, such as thermal dynamics, ADAS, and safety systems, as well as another layer related to the infotainment system. Bensaid didn’t provide detailed information about the AI assistant, but he did say it includes a mix of models that handle specific tasks. The result is a hybrid software stack that combines edge AI, where tasks are handled on the device, and cloud AI, in which large models that require more compute are handled by remote servers. This should mean a flexible, customized AI assistant that splits the workload between the edge and cloud. Rivian developed much of the AI software stack in-house, including its own custom models and the “orchestration layer,” the conductor or traffic cop of sorts that makes sure the various AI models work together. Rivian tapped other companies for specific agentic AI functions. The mission is to develop an AI assistant that increases customer trust and engagement, Bensaid said. For now, the AI assistant is staying within Rivian. The company’s joint venture with Volkswagen is focused on software, but not an AI assistant or anything to do with automated driving. The technology joint venture with Volkswagen, which was announced in 2024 and is worth up to $5.8 billion, is centered on the underlying electrical architecture and zonal compute, and infotainment. The joint venture officially kicked off in November 2024 and is expected to supply the electrical architecture and software for Volkswagen Group as early as 2027. Autonomy and AI are separate for now, but “it doesn’t mean that it may not be in the future,” Bensaid said."
"Three in 10 US teens use AI chatbots every day, but safety concerns are growing",https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/three-in-ten-u-s-teens-use-ai-chatbots-every-day-but-safety-concerns-are-growing/,"The Pew Research Center released a study on Tuesday that shows how young people are using both social media and AI chatbots. Teen internet safety has remained a global hot topic, with Australia planning to enforce a social media ban for under-16s starting on Wednesday. The impact of social media on teen mental health has been extensively debated — some studies show how online communities can improve mental health, while other research shows the adverse effects of doomscrolling or spending too much time online. The U.S. surgeon general even called for social media platforms to put warning labels on their products last year. Pew found that 97% of teens use the internet daily, with about 40% of respondents saying they are “almost constantly online.” While this marks a decrease from last year’s survey (46%), it’s significantly higher than the results from a decade ago, when 24% of teens said they were online almost constantly. But as the prevalence of AI chatbots grows in the U.S., this technology has become yet another factor in the internet’s impact on American youth. About three in 10 U.S. teens are using AI chatbots every day, the Pew study reveals, with 4% saying they use them almost constantly. Fifty-nine percent of teens say they use ChatGPT, which is more than twice as popular as the next two most-used chatbots, Google’s Gemini (23%) and Meta AI (20%). Forty-six percent of U.S. teens say that they use AI chatbots at least several times a week, while 36% report not using AI chatbots at all. Pew’s research also details how race, age, and class impact teen chatbot use. About 68% of Black and Hispanic teens surveyed said they use chatbots, compared to 58% of white respondents. In particular, Black teens were about twice as likely to use Gemini and Meta AI as white teens. “The racial and ethnic differences in teen chatbot use were striking […] but it’s tough to speculate about the reasons behind those differences,” Pew Research Associate Michelle Faverio told TechCrunch. “This pattern is consistent with other racial and ethnic differences we’ve seen in teen technology use. Black and Hispanic teens are more likely than white teens to say they’re on certain social media sites — such as TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram.” Across all internet use, Black (55%) and Hispanic teens (52%) were around twice as likely as white teens (27%) to say that they are online “almost constantly.” Older teens (ages 15 to 17) tend to use both social media and AI chatbots more often than younger teens (ages 13 to 14). When it comes to household income, about 62% of teens living in households making more than $75,000 per year said they use ChatGPT, compared to 52% of teens below that threshold. But Character.AI usage is twice as popular (14%) in homes with incomes below $75,000. While teenagers may start out using these tools for basic questions or homework help, their relationship to AI chatbots can become addictive and potentially harmful. The families of at least two teens, Adam Raine and Amaurie Lacey, have sued ChatGPT maker OpenAI for its alleged role in their children’s suicides — in both cases, ChatGPT gave the teenagers detailed instructions on how to hang themselves, which were tragically effective. (OpenAI claims it should not be held liable for Raine’s death because the sixteen-year-old allegedly circumvented ChatGPT’s safety features and thus violated the chatbot’s terms of service; the company has yet to respond to the Lacey family’s complaint.) Character.AI, an AI role-playing platform, is also facing scrutiny for its impact on teen mental health; at least two teenagers died by suicide after having prolonged conversations with AI chatbots. The startup ended up making the decision to stop offering its chatbots to minors, and instead launched a product called “Stories” for underage users that more closely resembles a choose-your-own-adventure game. The experiences reflected in the lawsuits against these companies make up a small percentage of all interactions that happen on ChatGPT or Character.AI. In many cases, conversations with chatbots can be incredibly benign. According to OpenAI’s data, only 0.15% of ChatGPT’s active users have conversations about suicide each week — but on a platform with 800 million weekly active users, that small percentage reflects over one million people who discuss suicide with the chatbot per week. “Even if [AI companies’] tools weren’t designed for emotional support, people are using them in that way, and that means companies do have a responsibility to adjust their models to be solving for user well-being,” Dr. Nina Vasan, a psychiatrist and director of Brainstorm: The Stanford Lab for Mental Health Innovation, told TechCrunch.

Slack CEO Denise Dresser to join OpenAI as chief revenue officer,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/slack-ceo-denise-dresser-to-join-openai-as-chief-revenue-officer/,"OpenAI is hiring Slack CEO Denise Dresser as its new chief revenue officer. The news was first reported by Wired, then confirmed by OpenAI in a blog post. Dresser’s new role comes after more than 14 years at Salesforce, Slack’s parent company. While at Slack, Dresser oversaw the introduction of several AI features. OpenAI says that Dresser will be responsible for the company’s revenue strategy in enterprise and customer success. That’s a pivotal role, given that the company has a rocky road ahead if it ever wants to turn a profit. “We’re on a path to put AI tools into the hands of millions of workers, across every industry,” Fidji Simo, OpenAI’s CEO of Applications, said in a statement. “Denise has led that kind of shift before, and her experience will help us make AI useful, reliable, and accessible for businesses everywhere.” Like Dresser, Simo also joined OpenAI this year after a long track record of high-profile leadership, most recently as CEO of Instacart, which has become a close partner of OpenAI. According to Wired, Slack’s chief product officer, Rob Seaman, will become interim CEO of Slack."
"Amazon’s Ring rolls out controversial, AI-powered facial-recognition feature to video doorbells",https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/amazons-ring-rolls-out-controversial-ai-powered-facial-recognition-feature-to-video-doorbells/,"Dystopian or useful? Amazon’s Ring doorbells will now be able to identify your visitors through a new AI-powered facial-recognition feature, the company said on Tuesday. The controversial feature, dubbed “Familiar Faces,” was announced earlier this September and is now rolling out to Ring device owners in the United States. Amazon says the feature lets you identify the people who regularly come to your door by creating a catalog of up to 50 faces. These could include family members, friends and neighbors, delivery drivers, household staff, and others. After you label someone in the Ring app, the device will recognize them as they approach the Ring’s camera. Then, instead of alerting you that “a person is at your door,” you’ll receive a personalized notification, like “Mom at Front Door,” the company explains in its launch announcement. The feature has already received pushback from consumer protection organizations, like the EFF, and a U.S. senator. Amazon Ring owners can use the feature to help them disable alerts they don’t want to see — like those notifications referencing their own comings and goings, for instance, the company says. And they can set these alerts on a per-face basis. The feature is not enabled by default. Instead, users will need to turn it on in their app’s settings. Meanwhile, faces can be named in the app directly from the Event History section or from the new Familiar Faces library. Once labeled, the face will be named in all notifications, in the app’s timeline, and in the Event History. These labels can be edited at any time, and there are tools to merge duplicates or delete faces. Amazon claims the face data is encrypted and never shared with others. Plus, it says unnamed faces are automatically removed after 30 days. Despite Amazon’s privacy assurances, the addition of the feature raises concerns. The company has a history of forging partnerships with law enforcement and even once gave police and fire departments the ability to request data from the Ring Neighbors app by asking Amazon directly for people’s doorbell footage. More recently, Amazon partnered with Flock, the maker of AI-powered surveillance cameras used by police, federal law enforcement, and a division of ICE, per a 404Media report. (Flock Safety emailed after publication to comment that ICE is not using Flock.) Ring’s own security efforts have fallen short in the past. Ring had to pay a $5.8 million fine in 2023 after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission found that Ring employees and contractors had broad and unrestricted access to customers’ videos for years. Its Neighbors app also exposed users’ home addresses and precise locations, and users’ Ring passwords have been floating around the dark web for years. Given Amazon’s willingness to work with law enforcement and digital surveillance providers, combined with its poor security track record, we’d suggest Ring owners, at the very least, be careful about identifying anyone using their proper name; better yet, keep the feature disabled and just look to see who it is. Not everything needs an AI upgrade. As a result of the privacy concerns, Amazon’s Ring has already faced calls from U.S. senator Ed Markey (D-Mass.) to abandon this feature, and is facing backlash from consumer protection organizations, like the EFF. Privacy laws are preventing Amazon from launching the feature in Illinois, Texas, and Portland, Oregon, the EFF had also noted. In response to questions posed by the organization, Amazon said the users’ biometric data will be processed in the cloud and claimed it doesn’t use the data to train AI models. It also claimed it wouldn’t be able to identify all the locations where a person had been detected, from a technical standpoint, even if law enforcement requested this data. However, it’s unclear why that would not be the case, given the similarity to the “Search Party” feature that looks across a neighborhood’s network of Ring cameras to find lost dogs and cats. Reached for comment, EFF’s Staff Attorney, F. Mario Trujillo, said, “Knocking on a door, or even just walking in front of it, shouldn’t require abandoning your privacy. With this feature going live, it’s more important than ever that state privacy regulators step in to investigate, protect people’s privacy, and test the strength of their biometric privacy laws.” Updated after publication with EFF comment."
"OpenAI, Anthropic, and Block join new Linux Foundation effort to standardize the AI agent era",https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/openai-anthropic-and-block-join-new-linux-foundation-effort-to-standardize-the-ai-agent-era/,"As AI moves beyond chatbots and toward systems that can take actions, the Linux Foundation is launching a new group dedicated to keeping AI agents from splintering into a mess of incompatible, locked-down products.  The group, dubbed the Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF), will act as a neutral home for open source projects related to AI agents. Anchoring the AAIF at launch are donations from Anthropic, Block, and OpenAI.  Anthropic is donating its MCP (Model Context Protocol), a standard way to connect models and agents to tools and data; Block is contributing Goose, its open source agent framework; and OpenAI is bringing AGENTS.md to the table, its simple instruction file developers can add to a repository to tell AI coding tools how to behave. You can think of these tools as the basic plumbing of the agent era.  Other members in the AAIF include AWS, Bloomberg, Cloudflare, and Google, signaling an industry-level push for shared guardrails so that AI agents can be trustworthy at scale. In OpenAI engineer Nick Cooper’s view, protocols are essentially a shared language that lets different agents and systems work together without every developer reinventing integrations from scratch.  “We need multiple [protocols] to negotiate, communicate, and work together to deliver value for people, and that sort of openness and communication is why it’s not ever going to be one provider, one host, one company,” Cooper told TechCrunch.  Jim Zemlin, executive director of the Linux Foundation, put it more bluntly in conversations around the launch: The goal is to avoid a future of “closed wall” proprietary stacks, where tool connections, agent behavior, and orchestration are locked behind a handful of platforms. “By bringing these projects together under the AAIF, we are now able to coordinate interoperability, safety patterns, and best practices specifically for AI agents,” Zemlin said.  Block — the fintech company behind Square and Cash App — isn’t known for AI infrastructure, but it’s making an openness play with Goose. AI tech lead Brad Axen frames it as proof that open alternatives can match proprietary agents at scale, with thousands of engineers using it weekly for coding, data analysis, and documentation. Open sourcing Goose serves a dual purpose for Block.  “Getting it out into the world gives us a place for other people to come help us make it better,” Axen told TechCrunch. “We have a lot of contributors from open source, and everything they do to improve it comes back to our company.”  Meanwhile, donating Goose to the Linux Foundation gives Block access to community stress tests while positioning it as a working example of AAIF’s vision — an agent framework designed to plug into shared building blocks like MCP and AGENTS.md. Anthropic is making a similar move at the protocol layer, handing MCP to the Linux Foundation. The goal: make MCP the neutral infrastructure connecting AI models to tools, data, and applications without endless one-off adapters. “The main goal is to have enough adoption in the world that it’s the de facto standard,” MCP co-creator David Soria Parra told TechCrunch. “We’re all better off if we have an open integration center where you can build something once as a developer and use it across any client.” Donating MCP to AAIF signals that the protocol won’t be controlled by a single vendor. That governance point is central to why the Linux Foundation created a new umbrella at all. The organization already hosts major AI and developer infrastructure projects — everything from PyTorch and Ray to Kubernetes — but says AAIF is specifically aimed at agent standards and orchestration, including shared safety patterns and interoperability. AAIF’s structure is funded through a “directed fund,” meaning companies can contribute money through membership dues. But Zemlin of the Linux Foundation argues that funding doesn’t equal control: Project roadmaps are set by technical steering committees, and no single member gets unilateral say over direction. Still, the big question is whether AAIF becomes real infrastructure or just another industry logo alliance.  “An early indicator of success, in addition to adoption of these standards, would be the development and implementation of shared standards being used by vendor agents around the world,” Zemlin said.  For OpenAI’s Cooper, success would look like an evolution of standards: “I don’t want it to be a stagnant thing. I don’t want these protocols to be part of this foundation, and that’s where they sat for two years. They should evolve and continually accept further input.” There’s also a more subtle consequence: Even with open governance, one company’s implementation could become the default simply because it ships fastest or gains the most usage. Zemlin says that’s not necessarily a bad thing, though. He points to open source history — like Kubernetes “winning” the container race — as evidence that “dominance emerges from merit and not vendor control.” For developers and enterprises, the short-term appeal is clear: less time building custom connectors, more predictable agent behavior across codebases, and simpler deployment in security-conscious environments. The larger vision is more ambitious: If tools like MCP, AGENTS.md, and Goose become standard infrastructure, the agent landscape could shift from closed platforms to an open, mix-and-match software world reminiscent of the interoperable systems that built the modern web."
"Amazon adds delivery tracking, last-minute adds, gift ideas to Alexa+",https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/amazon-adds-delivery-tracking-last-minute-adds-gift-ideas-to-alexa/,"Amazon has long had to deal with the reality that owners of its Echo smart speakers weren’t using its voice-controlled assistant, Alexa, to buy things, as it had hoped. The tech giant hasn’t given up on that dream yet: Its AI assistant, Alexa+, is getting new shopping-enabled features in the U.S. and Canada from today, including a shopping hub, tools to add items to recent orders, and personalized recommendations. The company has already been working on features that make Alexa+ more of a shopping assistant with abilities like automated deal tracking and automatic purchases. The former feature lets you set Alexa to alert you when items in your cart or list drop below a certain price point. If you also have automatic purchases set up, Alexa can immediately order an item when it reaches that target price. Now, Amazon says it’s turning its Echo devices with a screen — the Echo Show 15 and 21 — into a shopping hub with an interface that it’s calling the “Shopping Essentials” experience. From this dashboard, Amazon shoppers can track deliveries in real time, see information about recent orders, get reminders about household essentials they need to reorder, and view their shopping list and saved items. The screen would also let shoppers tap to see more products and add items directly to their cart and then check out. To access the new experience, Amazon users can say “Alexa, where’s my stuff?” or “Open Shopping Essentials.” Soon, a shopping widget will be available to add to the Echo device’s home screen, too. Another new feature rolling out now will allow Alexa device owners to add items to an upcoming delivery at any time until the item leaves the warehouse. This builds on a similar feature recently added to Amazon’s retail website and app, so it isn’t necessarily an Alexa+ exclusive, but the feature wasn’t live on Alexa devices so far. Alexa+ is also gaining the ability to recommend gifts. You’ll be able to describe who you’re shopping for, or the occasion, and Alexa+ will display product suggestions on the screen, organized into categories. Amazon says Alexa+ is now available to “tens of millions” of customers, and these new features are live for users in the U.S. and Canada. While not everyone has been happy with Alexa+, the company says the percentage of users who downgraded back to the AI-free interface remains in the “very low single digits.”"
Google’s first AI glasses expected next year,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/googles-first-ai-glasses-expected-next-year/,"Google will launch its first AI glasses in 2026, according to a company blog post. At Google’s I/O event in May, the company announced partnerships with Gentle Monster and Warby Parker to create consumer wearables based on Android XR, the operating system that powers Samsung’s Galaxy XR headset. But you can’t wear a bulky headset while out in the real world, which makes smart glasses appealing as a less obtrusive smart wearable. “For AI and XR to be truly helpful, the hardware needs to fit seamlessly into your life and match your personal style,” Google writes. “We want to give you the freedom to choose the right balance of weight, style and immersion for your needs.” Google is working on various types of AI-powered glasses — one model is designed for screen-free assistance, using built-in speakers, microphones, and cameras to allow the user to communicate with Gemini and take photos. The other model has an in-lens display — which is only visible to the person wearing the glasses — that can show turn-by-turn directions or closed captioning. Google also shared a preview of the wired XR glasses from Xreal called Project Aura. This model situates itself between a bulky headset and an unobtrusive pair of glasses. Beyond just an in-lens display, the Project Aura glasses can function as an extended workplace or entertainment device, allowing the user to use Google’s suite of products or stream video as they would in a more advanced headset. While Meta has gotten off to an early lead in smart glasses development, Google now joins Apple and Snap among the companies expected to challenge Meta with their own hardware next year. Meta’s smart glasses have caught on in part thanks to its partnership with Ray-Ban, and it sells these products in retail stores. Google’s partnership with Warby Parker seems like it will follow a similar strategy, committing $75 million thus far to support the eyewear company’s product development and commercialization costs. If Warby Parker meets certain milestones, Google will commit an additional $75 million and take an equity stake in the brand. "
EU launches antitrust probe into Google’s AI search tools,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/eu-launches-antitrust-probe-into-googles-ai-search-tools/,"Even as Big Tech and American tech elites criticize how the European Union is implementing rules to regulate tech and AI on the continent, the bloc isn’t letting competition concerns slide. The European Commission has launched an investigation into whether Google may have breached EU’s competition laws by using content from websites without compensating owners to generate answers for its AI summaries that appear above search results. The EC also will look at how AI summaries use videos from YouTube to generate answers. The investigation will examine if Google is harming competition in the AI market by granting itself access to websites’ content, and imposing “unfair terms and conditions on publishers and content creators.” “The Commission will investigate to what extent the generation of AI Overviews and AI Mode by Google is based on web publishers’ content without appropriate compensation for that, and without the possibility for publishers to refuse without losing access to Google Search,” the bloc’s executive arm wrote in a statement. Google’s AI Overview and AI Mode are the two chief products being investigated here, and the EC highlights that the tech giant doesn’t leave websites or content producers with much choice since it directs a majority of web traffic, doesn’t pay them for using their content, and doesn’t allow YouTube uploads if you don’t let Google use that data. The EU is also concerned over the fact that Google doesn’t allow rival AI companies to use YouTube content to train their own AI models. “This complaint risks stifling innovation in a market that is more competitive than ever,” a Google spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “Europeans deserve to benefit from the latest technologies and we will continue to work closely with the news and creative industries as they transition to the AI era.” The investigation comes at a time when companies developing AI models and content are being sued for copyright infringement by publishers and websites. AI search tool Perplexity, for one, has been sued by several  outlets, including The New York Times, Chicago Tribune, News Corp, New York Post, Merriam-Webster, Nikkei, and Reddit. The EU’s investigation differs, however, because in many cases, these media companies are suing as a way to negotiate content-licensing deals with AI firms in hopes of compensating creators and being paid for their content. The EU is seeking to level the playing field for AI companies that compete with Google, which according to some reports, benefits from its reach by being able to train its AI models on much more of the internet than its rivals. Under consistent and widespread criticism of its AI regulation, however, the EU is considering simplifying its AI rules, and has proposed to delay the implementation of rules for the use of AI in high-risk applications."
Microsoft to invest $17.5B in India by 2029 as AI race accelerates,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/microsoft-to-invest-17-5b-in-india-by-2029-as-ai-race-accelerates/,"Microsoft plans to invest $17.5 billion in India over the next four years, expanding its AI and cloud footprint in the South Asian nation, whose vast online and smartphone user base is turning it into a critical battleground for global tech companies. Announced on Tuesday, the investment — Microsoft’s largest in Asia — will fund new data centers, AI infrastructure, and skilling programs from 2026 to 2029, building on the $3 billion the company committed in India in January. Microsoft’s move comes as major U.S. tech companies ramp up spending on data centers and AI compute worldwide, with India emerging as a strategic prize thanks to its fast-growing developer base and one of the world’s largest pools of internet and smartphone users. The latest push also puts pressure on rivals such as Google, Amazon, and OpenAI, which are growing their presence in India to tap demand for cloud services and AI tools from businesses, startups, and government agencies. Moreover, the investment aligns with New Delhi’s push to accelerate digital infrastructure and AI adoption across sectors, as India looks to position itself as a global technology hub while addressing concerns around data governance and equitable access. The announcement comes during Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s visit to India and follows his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday, ahead of a keynote in New Delhi on Wednesday. The Redmond-based company also said it will open a new data center region in Hyderabad by mid-2026, its largest in India, comprising three availability zones — a footprint the company described as roughly the size of two Eden Gardens stadiums. Microsoft said it will continue expanding its three existing data-center regions in Chennai, Hyderabad, and Pune. As part of the push, Microsoft also announced it will work with the Ministry of Labour and Employment to integrate advanced AI capabilities into two of its flagship digital public platforms — e-Shram and the National Career Service — to offer AI-driven services to more than 310 million informal workers. The two Indian government platforms will use Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI Service to provide multilingual access, AI-assisted job matching, predictive analytics on skill and demand trends, automated résumé creation, and personalized pathways, the company said. Microsoft also said it is rolling out new sovereign cloud options for Indian customers, including a Sovereign Public Cloud now available across its India regions and a Sovereign Private Cloud powered by Azure Local for both connected and air-gapped operations. The offerings would help enterprises meet regulatory and data-residency requirements and support high-performance workloads with access to the latest Nvidia GPUs and Microsoft 365 services, the company noted. Additionally, Microsoft said its skilling efforts are also accelerating, noting that through its “ADVANTA(I)GE India” initiative, it has trained 5.6 million people since January — well ahead of its goal of training 10 million by 2030 — with the programs enabling more than 125,000 individuals to secure jobs or start businesses. The company is doubling its earlier commitment and now aims to equip 20 million Indians with basic AI skills by 2030, working with government agencies, industry partners, and digital public platforms to broaden access to training. Microsoft’s investment commitment comes just months after Google announced a $15 billion plan to build an AI hub and data-center infrastructure in India — the company’s largest investment in the country and one that follows its earlier $10 billion pledge in 2020. In the recent months, India has emerged as an especially attractive market for global tech companies as they look for regions to expand their AI footprint, drawn by the country’s vast base of internet subscribers, hundreds of millions of smartphone users, a fast-growing startup ecosystem, and the Indian government’s aggressive digitization agenda — all of which promise both consumer scale and enterprise demand. The push has accelerated this year, with OpenAI and Anthropic setting up offices in India, and Google and Perplexity striking partnerships with major telecom operators Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel, respectively, to deepen their reach in the market. However, even as global tech firms ramp up investment, hyperscalers are expected to face significant constraints in India, where data-center expansion is challenged by patchy power availability, high energy costs, and water scarcity in several regions — factors that could slow the build-out of AI infrastructure and raise operating expenses for cloud providers. Nonetheless, the Indian government has been pushing aggressively to draw more big-tech investment, framing large-scale data-center and AI projects as central to its economic and digital-public-infrastructure ambitions. Despite the constraints, New Delhi has rolled out incentives for AI and semiconductor projects, eased some regulatory hurdles, and encouraged partnerships with domestic telecom and IT firms to anchor more of the global AI value chain in India. When it comes to AI, the world is optimistic about India! Had a very productive discussion with Mr. Satya Nadella. Happy to see India being the place where Microsoft will make its largest-ever investment in Asia. The youth of India will harness this opportunity to innovate… https://t.co/fMFcGQ8ctK “Microsoft has been part of India’s fabric for more than three decades,” said Puneet Chandok, president, Microsoft India and South Asia, in a prepared statement. “As the nation moves confidently into its AI-first future, we are proud to stand as a trusted partner in advancing the infrastructure, innovation, and opportunity that can power a billion dreams.” Microsoft already employs more than 22,000 people across Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, Gurugram, Noida, and other cities, including engineering teams that build AI products such as Copilot Studio, Azure AI Search, AI agents, speech and translation tools, and Azure Machine Learning for global markets, while also supporting the company’s domestic operations."
"India proposes charging OpenAI, Google for training AI on copyrighted content",https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/india-proposes-charging-openai-google-for-training-ai-on-copyrighted-content/,"India has proposed a mandatory royalty system for AI companies that train their models on copyrighted content — a move that could reshape how OpenAI and Google operate in what has already become one of their most important and fastest-growing markets globally. On Tuesday, India’s Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade released a proposed framework that would give AI companies access to all copyrighted works for training in exchange for paying royalties to a new collecting body composed of rights-holding organizations, with payments then distributed to creators. The proposal argues that this “mandatory blanket license” would lower compliance costs for AI firms while ensuring that writers, musicians, artists, and other rights holders are compensated when their work is scraped to train commercial models. India’s proposal comes amid mounting concerns in global markets over how AI companies train their models on copyrighted material, a practice that has triggered lawsuits from authors, news organizations, artists, and other rights holders in the U.S. and Europe. Courts and regulators are still weighing whether such training qualifies as fair use, leaving AI firms operating under legal uncertainty and allowing them to rapidly expand their business without clear regulations. Unlike the U.S. and the European Union, where policymakers are debating transparency obligations and fair-use boundaries, India is proposing one of the most interventionist approaches yet by giving AI companies automatic access to copyrighted material in exchange for mandatory payment. The eight-member committee, formed by the Indian government in late April, argues the system would avoid years of legal uncertainty while ensuring creators are compensated from the outset. Defending the system, the committee says in a 125-page submission (PDF) that a blanket license “aims to provide an easy access to content for AI developers… reduce transaction costs… [and] ensure fair compensation for rightsholders,” calling it the least burdensome way to manage large-scale AI training. The submission adds that the single collecting body would function as a “single window,” eliminating the need for individual negotiations and enabling royalties to flow to both registered and unregistered creators. The committee also points to India’s growing importance as a market for GenAI tools. Citing OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s remark that India is the company’s second-largest market after the U.S. and “may well become our largest,” it argues that because AI firms derive significant revenue from Indian users while relying on Indian creators’ work to train their models, a portion of that value should flow back to those creators. That, it says, is part of the rationale for establishing a “balanced framework” that guarantees compensation. India’s proposal lands amid intensifying legal battles worldwide over whether AI companies can lawfully use copyrighted material to train their models. In India, news agency ANI sued OpenAI in the Delhi High Court, arguing its articles were used without permission — a case that has prompted the court to examine whether AI training is itself an act of reproduction or protected by “fair dealing.” Courts in the U.S. and Europe are confronting similar disputes, with creators alleging that tech companies have built their models on unlicensed content. Not everyone is convinced by the Indian government’s proposed model, though. Nasscom, the industry body representing technology firms, including Google and Microsoft, filed a formal dissent arguing that India should instead adopt a broad text-and-data-mining exception that would allow AI developers to train on copyrighted content as long as the material is lawfully accessed. It warned that a mandatory licensing regime could slow innovation and said rightsholders who object should be allowed to opt out rather than force companies to pay for all training data. The Business Software Alliance, which represents global tech firms, including Adobe, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft, pressed the Indian government to avoid a purely licensing-based regime. It urged India to introduce an explicit text-and-data-mining exception, arguing that “relying solely on direct or statutory licensing for AI training data may be impractical and may not yield the best outcomes.” Limiting AI models to smaller sets of licensed or public-domain material, BSA warned, could reduce model quality and “increase the risk that outputs simply reflect trends and biases of the limited training data sets,” adding that a clear TDM exception would better balance innovation and rights holders’ interests. The committee did not consider both a broad text-and-data-mining exception and an opt-out model, arguing that such systems either undermine copyright protections or are impossible to enforce. Instead, it proposed a “hybrid model” that would grant AI firms automatic access to all lawfully available copyrighted works while requiring them to pay royalties into the central collecting body that distributes the proceeds to creators. The Indian government has now opened the proposal for public consultation, giving companies and other stakeholders 30 days to submit their comments. After reviewing the feedback, the committee will finalize its recommendations before the framework is taken up by the government. OpenAI and Google did not respond to requests for comments."
Anthropic and Accenture sign multi-year AI strategic partnership,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/anthropic-and-accenture-sign-multi-year-ai-strategic-partnership/,"AI research lab Anthropic continues to cement its stake as the predominant AI player in the enterprise space. On Tuesday, Anthropic announced a multi-year partnership with professional services firm Accenture. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed; however, The Wall Street Journal reported that the deal is for three years. Accenture confirmed the deal is for three years but declined to comment on financials. TechCrunch reached out to Anthropic for more information. The two companies are forming the Accenture Anthropic Business Group. This will include formal Claude training for Accenture’s 30,000 employees. Anthropic’s Claude Code coding tools will be available for Accenture’s tens of thousands of developers. They are also launching a joint initiative to help chief investment officers track their return on investment for AI. This announcement comes as Anthropic’s market share within enterprise continues to grow. A new report from Menlo Ventures shows that Anthropic holds 40% of the market share within enterprise and 54% of the market share when it comes to coding. This marks a bump from Menlo’s previous survey this summer, where Anthropic held 32% of the enterprise market share. Anthropic announced a $200 million deal with cloud data company Snowflake last week. The company also announced sizable and similar AI partnerships with both Deloitte and IBM in October. "
Pebble’s founder introduces a $75 AI smart ring for recording brief notes with a press of a button,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/pebbles-founder-introduces-a-75-ai-smart-ring-for-recording-brief-notes-with-a-press-of-a-button/,"After rebooting the Pebble smartwatch brand, founder Eric Migicovsky is expanding his company’s device lineup with a new smart wearable: an AI-powered smart ring known as Index 01. Named for the finger where the ring is meant to be worn, the new $75 ring is not meant to be a competitor to always-on, always-listening AI devices, like the AI pendant Friend, but instead offers a way to record quick notes and reminders with a press of a button on the ring’s side. AI only comes into play via the open source, speech-to-text, and AI models that run locally on your smartphone through the Pebble mobile app. That is, if the ring’s button is not being pressed, it’s not recording. (And this is a press-and-hold gesture, too, which means you can’t start the ring’s recording and then let go to surreptitiously record a conversation.) You can wear the stainless steel ring while in the shower, washing hands, doing dishes, or in the rain, but you have to take it off for other water-related activities, like swimming. At launch, it’s water-resistant to 1 meter. The ring is also not a fitness tracker or sleep monitor. It doesn’t record details about your heart rate or health. And it’s not there to be your AI friend. “I’m not trying to build some AI assistant thing,” Migicovsky told TechCrunch in an interview. “I build things that solve one main problem, and they solve it really well,” he explains. “I think of [the ring] as external memory for my brain … That’s what this is. It’s always with you.” Plus, the ring has been designed to be highly reliable and privacy-preserving, he says, as all your thoughts are stored on your phone, not in the cloud. There is no subscription. Migicovsky’s ring enters a growing market for voice-note wearables. Last month, Sandbar, a New York-based startup founded by former Meta employees, unveiled its Stream Ring, which also lets users record thoughts via a touch-activated microphone. However, unlike Index 01’s no-subscription model, Sandbar’s $249 ring offers both a free tier with limited AI interactions and a $10-per-month Stream Pro subscription for unlimited chats and early access to features. The Stream Ring is expected to ship next summer. Migicovsky has been wearing his own ring for three months now and says he cannot imagine going back to a world where he doesn’t always have a memory device with him. “The problem is that, during the day, I get ideas or I remember something, and if I don’t write it down that second, I forget it,” he says. The ring solves this problem, he adds, without becoming another device you need to charge. “The battery lasts for years,” Migicovsky claims. The ring is said to support roughly 12 to 14 hours of recording. On average, the founder says he uses it 10 to 20 times per day to record 3- to 6-second thoughts. At that rate, he’ll get about two years of usage. When the ring’s battery dies, you can ship it back to the company for recycling. When using the Index, you can record up to five minutes of audio, which can be saved to the ring and synced to your phone later. This makes sense for recording briefer, personal thoughts and notes, even when you don’t have your phone handy, but it wouldn’t work for recording a longer chat, like a presentation, meeting, or in-person interview of some kind. The ring also supports more than 100 languages and has a bit of on-device memory for times when you’re not in Bluetooth range of your device, where the recording is ultimately saved and transcribed. (The raw audio is retained, too, in case the speech-to-text is garbled due to loud background noise.) If you own a Pebble smartwatch or one from another brand, your recorded thought can even appear on the watch’s screen so you can verify it’s correct. The ring works with Pebble’s mobile app, which offers notes and reminders but can optionally integrate with your phone’s calendaring system, too, or other apps, like Notion. And the ring’s software is open source, which makes it hackable by the community, the founder points out. Because of its open nature, the ring’s button is already programmable. In addition to the press-and-hold gesture, you can program the ring to do other things with a single or double press, like play or pause your music or control the shutter on your phone’s camera. You could use it to send a message through the universal chat app Beeper, which Migicovsky also created, or you could add your own voice actions via MCP. Migicovsky acknowledges that hardware can be difficult to get right, as Pebble’s exit to Fitbit showed. (Fitbit was later acquired by Google in 2021.) “I didn’t earn any money during Pebble — we exited, but it was not a great exit,” Migicovsky admits. This year, however, he decided to reboot the Pebble project after Google open sourced PebbleOS, which opened the door to new hardware. With his new company, Core Devices, Migicovsky plans to do things differently. Still, the founder doesn’t regret his previous choices, he clarifies. “I wouldn’t have gone back and changed anything. I loved what we built. I loved what we did. I love the company that we built, but it’s not the only way to build a company,” he told TechCrunch. “And speaking as an ex-YC partner, there’s a time and a place for building a venture-backed startup. Some companies are phenomenal when they raise money and build a big team, and I tried that … What I’m doing now is trying an alternative path, which is [to] start from profitability,” he says. The new company is a small team of five, self-funded, and focused on sustainability. So far, Core Devices has shipped the Pebble 2 Duo smartwatch with a black-and-white display. Its first run sold out, and the company is now preparing to ship the upgraded version, the Pebble Time 2. The newer device, which has seen 25,000 preorders, is a stainless steel watch with a larger, color e-ink screen. As for the Index 01, the ring’s preorder offer ends in March 2026. After that, the price increases to $99. It currently comes in silver, polished gold, and matte black and works with iOS and Android devices. Customers can select from eight ring sizes, ranging from 6 to 13. "
Mistral AI surfs vibe-coding tailwinds with new coding models,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/mistral-ai-surfs-vibe-coding-tailwinds-with-new-coding-models/,"French AI startup Mistral today launched Devstral 2, a new generation of its AI model designed for coding, as the company seeks to catch up to bigger AI labs like Anthropic and other coding-focused LLMs. This announcement follows the recent launch of the Mistral 3 family of open-weight models and confirms Mistral’s intent to close in on its bigger and better-funded AI rivals. The unicorn is also jumping into the vibe-coding race, which has fueled the rise of companies like Cursor and Supabase, with Mistral Vibe, a new command-line interface (CLI) aimed at facilitating code automation through natural language, with tools for file manipulation, code searching, version control, and command execution.  Mistral AI is betting on the added value of context awareness, which is particularly relevant in business use cases. Similar to its AI assistant, Le Chat, which can remember previous conversations with users and use that context to guide its answers, Vibe CLI features persistent history and can scan file structures and Git statuses to build context to inform its behavior. This focus on production-grade workflows also explains why Devstral 2 is relatively demanding, requiring at least four H100 GPUs or equivalent for deployment, and weighing 123 billion parameters. However, the model is also available in a smaller size with Devstral Small, which, at 24 billion parameters, makes it deployable locally on consumer hardware.  The models differ in their open source licensing — Devstral 2 ships under a modified MIT license, while Devstral Small uses Apache 2.0. They also differ in pricing. Devstral 2 is currently free to use via the company’s API. After the free period, the API pricing will cost $0.40/$2.00 per million tokens (input/output) for Devstral 2, and $0.10/$0.30 for Devstral Small. Mistral has partnered with agent tools Kilo Code and Cline to release Devstral 2 to users, while Mistral Vibe CLI is available as an extension in Zed for use inside the IDE. Europe’s champion AI lab, Mistral is currently valued at €11.7 billion (approximately $13.8 billion) following a Series C funding round led by Dutch semiconductor company ASML, which invested €1.3 billion (approximately $1.5 billion) in September."
Empromptu raises $2M pre-seed to help enterprises build AI apps,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/empromptu-raises-2m-pre-seed-to-help-enterprises-build-ai-apps/,"Shanea Leven says she learned two important lessons when building her first company, CodeSee. The first lesson was knowing the difference between what businesses need versus what sounds visionary; the second was that the fundamentals always apply, even with new technologies such as AI. “Security, compliance, reliability, quality, those things don’t just go away for enterprise applications,” she said. After CodeSee was acquired in 2024, Leven decided that she wanted to build a product that would let business owners, even those without technical backgrounds, build AI applications. She teamed up with AI researcher Sean Robinson, and last October, the two launched Empromptu, an AI service that businesses can use to build AI applications. Empromptu claims all a user has to do is tell the platform’s AI chatbot what they want — like a new classification app or a generative recommendation app — and the tool will go ahead and build it. It also provides LLM tools to help users if they want to fine-tune any results and lets companies add AI features to their own existing code bases. Leven doesn’t consider it a vibe-coding platform, though she does look to compete with companies like Replit and Lovable. “Vibe coding is excellent for quick experiments, but Empromptu is what turns those experiments into real software,” she said. Empromptu, she continued, “turns ideas into production features with built-in evaluation, governance, and self-improvement. You ship to real customers, with real data and complete control. If vibe coding is the brainstorm, Empromptu is the build.” On Tuesday, the company said it had raised $2 million in a pre-seed funding round led by Precursor Ventures. Zeal Capital, Alumni Ventures, FoundersEdge, and South Loop also participated.  Leven said the fresh capital will be used for hiring staff and developing new proprietary technology. It also announced three new features, including the ability to create custom data models and infinite memory. The company is hoping to target businesses launching in regulated industries or “deeply complex” areas that involve capturing data and creating applications — software that services hotels, for example. Overall, Leven hopes that founders feel their businesses can be transformed without having to learn the technical skills to take advantage of the AI revolution. “It’s just like any other skill,” Leven said. “And the beauty of this skill is that AI can help you learn it along the way.”   This piece was updated to clarify what Empromptu does."
Department of Commerce approves Nvidia H200 chip exports to China,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/department-of-commerce-may-approve-nvidia-h200-chip-exports-to-china/,"Advanced Nvidia AI chips can head back to China after all. The Department of Commerce will allow Nvidia to ship H200 chips to China, as originally reported by Semafor, to approved customers in the country. The U.S. will take a 25% cut of these sales, CNBC reported. H200 chips are much more advanced than the H20 chips Nvidia developed specifically for the Chinese market, but the company would only be able to send H200s that are roughly 18 months old, Semafor reported. An Nvidia spokesperson told TechCrunch of the development: “We applaud President Trump’s decision to allow America’s chip industry to compete to support high paying jobs and manufacturing in America. Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America.” The news report comes a week after U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the decision on exporting these H200 chips to China was in President Donald Trump’s hands. The decision to send the chips to China conflicts with Congressional concerns about national security. Pete Ricketts, a Republican senator from Nebraska, and Chris Coons, a Democratic senator from Delaware, introduced a bill on December 4 that would block the export of advanced AI chips to China for more than two years. The Secure and Feasible Exports Act (SAFE) Chips Act would require the Department of Commerce to deny any export license on advanced AI chips to China for 30 months. It’s unclear when legislators will vote on the proposed bill especially now that the Trump administration has given the green light to sell the H200 chips. While Congress has long been clear about sending advanced AI chips to China — on both sides of the aisle — President Trump has waffled on whether or not to allow the exports. The Trump administration hit chip companies like Nvidia with licensing requirements to send their chips to China in April before it formally rescinded a Biden administration diffusion rule that would have regulated AI chip exports in May. Over the summer, the U.S. government signaled that companies would be able to start sending chips to China as long as the government got a 15% cut of all revenue, as chips became a bargaining tool in trade talks with China. However, by that point, the market for U.S.-developed chips in China was strained. In September, China’s internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, banned domestic companies from buying Nvidia’s chips, leaving companies in the country to rely on less advanced domestic chips from Alibaba and Huawei. On Monday, Trump said that Chinese president Xi Jinping “responded positively” to the latest H200 news in a Truth Social post. This story was updated on December 8 when the proposed decision was confirmed. "
Google’s AI try-on app Doppl adds a shoppable discovery feed,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/googles-ai-try-on-app-doppl-adds-a-shoppable-discovery-feed/,"Google announced on Monday that it’s introducing a shoppable discovery feed in Doppl, its experimental app that uses AI to visualize how different outfits might look on you. The tech giant says the idea behind the new feed is to display recommendations so users can discover and virtually try on new items. Nearly everything in the feed is shoppable, with direct links to merchants. The discovery feed features AI-generated videos of real products and suggests outfits based on your personalized style. Google determines your style by analyzing the preferences you share with Doppl and the items you interact with. The move comes as short-form video feeds, particularly on TikTok and Instagram, have conditioned users to scroll visual feeds and buy what they see. However, unlike on TikTok and Instagram, where real influencers showcase products, Google’s new feed only consists of AI-generated content. While some may not be fond of an AI-generated feed, Google likely sees it as a way to surface products in a format that people are already used to. Plus, it makes sense for the company to try a new e-commerce strategy, especially as it continues to lose ground to companies like Amazon and social media platforms. It’s worth noting that AI-generated videos aren’t new to Doppl. While the app creates images of a virtual version of yourself wearing different outfits, it can turn these static images and convert them into AI-generated videos. The purpose of this is to give you a better sense of how the outfit would look on you in real life. The new discovery feed is rolling out to Doppl on iOS and Android in the U.S. for users 18 and above. Although a feed consisting solely of AI-generated content would have seemed strange a year ago, the idea is now gaining traction. For example, OpenAI in September launched Sora, a social media platform of just AI videos. Meta also has a short-form video feed of AI-generated videos called “Vibes” in the Meta AI app."
"Claude Code is coming to Slack, and that’s a bigger deal than it sounds",https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/claude-code-is-coming-to-slack-and-thats-a-bigger-deal-than-it-sounds/,"Anthropic is launching Claude Code in Slack, allowing developers to delegate coding tasks directly from chat threads. The beta feature, available Monday as a research preview, builds on Anthropic’s existing Slack integration by adding full workflow automation. The rollout signals that the next frontier in coding assistants isn’t the model; it’s the workflow.  Previously, developers could only get lightweight coding help via Claude in Slack — like writing snippets, debugging, and explanations. Now they can tag @Claude to spin up a complete coding session using Slack context like bug reports or feature requests. Claude analyzes recent messages to determine the right repository, posts progress updates in threads, and shares links to review work and open pull requests. The move reflects a broader industry shift: AI coding assistants are migrating from IDEs (integrated development environment, where software development happens) into collaboration tools where teams already work. Cursor offers Slack integration for drafting and debugging code in threads, while GitHub Copilot recently added features to generate pull requests from chat. OpenAI’s Codex is accessible via custom Slack bots. For Slack, positioning itself as an “agentic hub” where AI meets workplace context creates a strategic advantage: Whichever AI tool dominates Slack — the center of engineering communication — could shape how software teams work. By letting developers move seamlessly from conversation to code without switching apps, Claude Code and similar tools represent a shift toward AI-embedded collaboration that could fundamentally change developer workflows. While Anthropic has not yet confirmed when it would make a broader rollout available, the timing is strategic. The AI coding market is getting more competitive, and differentiation is starting to depend more on integration depth and distribution than model capability alone. That said, the integration raises questions about code security and IP protection, as it adds another platform through which sensitive repository access must be managed and audited — while also introducing new dependencies where outages or rate limits in either Slack or Claude’s API could disrupt development workflows that teams previously controlled locally. TechCrunch has reached out to Anthropic and Slack for more information.  "
Google details security measures for Chrome’s agentic features,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/google-details-security-measures-for-chromes-agentic-features/,"An increasing number of browsers are experimenting with agentic features that will take actions on your behalf, such as booking tickets or shopping for different items. However, these agentic capabilities also come with security risks that could lead to loss of data or money. Google detailed its approach to handling user security on Chrome using observer models and consent for user action. The company previewed agentic capabilities on Chrome in September and said these features will roll out in the coming months. The company said it is using the help of a few models to keep agentic actions in check. Google said it built a User Alignment Critic using Gemini to scrutinize the action items built by the planner model for a particular task. If the critic model thinks that the planned tasks don’t serve the user’s goal, it asks the planner model to rethink the strategy. Google noted that the critic model only sees the metadata of the proposed action and not the actual web content. What’s more, to prevent agents from accessing disallowed or untrustworthy sites, Google is using Agent Origin Sets, which restrict the model to access read-only origins and read-writeable origins. Read-only origin is data that Gemini is permitted to consume content from. For instance, on a shopping site, the listings are relevant to the task, but banner ads aren’t. Similarly, Google said the agent is only allowed to click or type on certain iframes of a page. “This delineation enforces that only data from a limited set of origins is available to the agent, and this data can only be passed on to the writable origins. This bounds the threat vector of cross-origin data leaks. This also gives the browser the ability to enforce some of that separation, such as by not even sending to the model data that is outside the readable set,” the company said in a blog post. Google is also keeping a check on page navigation by investigating URLs through another observer model. This can prevent navigation to harmful model-generated URLs, the company said. The search giant said that it is also handing over the reins to users for sensitive tasks. For instance, when an agent tries to navigate to a sensitive site with information like banking or your medical data, it first asks the user. For sites that require sign-in, it’ll ask the user for permission to let Chrome use the password manager. Google said that the agent’s model doesn’t have exposure to password data. The company added that it will ask users before taking actions like making a purchase or sending a message. Google said that, in addition to this, it also has a prompt-injection classifier to prevent unwanted actions and is also testing agentic capabilities against attacks created by researchers. AI browser makers are also paying attention to security. Earlier this month, Perplexity released a new open source content detection model to prevent prompt injection attacks against agents. "
You can buy your Instacart groceries without leaving ChatGPT,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/you-can-buy-your-instacart-groceries-without-leaving-chatgpt/,"OpenAI and Instacart are launching a grocery shopping experience inside of ChatGPT, allowing customers to brainstorm meal ideas, make a grocery list, and check out, all without leaving the chat interface. This builds upon an existing partnership between OpenAI and Instacart; more than two years ago, Instacart launched an in-app AI search tool powered by ChatGPT, which helps shoppers ask questions about what to make for dinner or how to accommodate dietary restrictions. The relationship between OpenAI and Instacart seems to have only deepened after former Instacart CEO Fidji Simo — who was already an OpenAI board member — joined the company as the CEO of Applications in May. Agentic commerce — the use of AI tools to do shopping research and make purchases on a user’s behalf — is a current priority for OpenAI. Its most recent dev day focused on its plan to build apps into ChatGPT. In an early preview for developers, ChatGPT launched integrations with apps like Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Expedia, Figma, Spotify, and Zillow; since then, OpenAI has announced further partnerships with Target, Intuit, and others. Leading up to this year’s holiday shopping season, both OpenAI and Perplexity announced in-app features that help users make decisions about what products to buy — so, you could ask ChatGPT to help you find the best deal on a gaming laptop that matches your specific criteria. Adobe predicted that AI-assisted online shopping will grow by 520% this holiday season. Despite ChatGPT’s immense popularity, OpenAI is not making a profit, and it may not for another several years — if it ever does. Its products are so resource-intensive that even subscription costs don’t account for how much compute power the company uses to make its product work. These agentic commerce tools could give OpenAI another way of making money, since it’ll take an undisclosed “small fee” when it helps merchants make a sale. But it would take a whole lot of ChatGPT-based shopping for these fees to make a dent in OpenAI’s debt. "
‘ONE RULE’: Trump says he’ll sign an executive order blocking state AI laws despite bipartisan pushback,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/one-rule-trump-says-hell-sign-an-executive-order-blocking-state-ai-laws-despite-bipartisan-pushback/,"President Donald Trump said on Monday he plans to ink an executive order this week that would limit states from enacting their own regulation of AI technology. “I will be doing a ONE RULE Executive Order this week,” Trump posted on social media. “You can’t expect a company to get 50 Approvals every time they want to do something.” “There must be only One Rulebook if we are going to continue to lead in AI,” Trump said. “We are beating ALL COUNTRIES at this point in the race, but that won’t last long if we are going to have 50 States, many of them bad actors, involved in RULES and the APPROVAL PROCESS…AI WILL BE DESTROYED IN ITS INFANCY!”  Trump’s statement comes days after an effort to preempt states from regulating AI was quashed in the Senate, as Congress couldn’t agree to insert the deeply unpopular proposal into a must-pass defense budget bill.  The fast pace of AI development and the lack of general consumer protections from the federal government has led many states to enact their own rules around the technology. California, for example, has the AI safety and transparency bill SB 53, while Tennessee’s ELVIS Act protects musicians and performers from unauthorized AI-generated deepfakes of their voices and likenesses.  Silicon Valley figures, including OpenAI President Greg Brockman and VC-turned-White House “AI czar” David Sacks, have argued that such laws by states would create an unworkable patchwork of laws that would stifle innovation and threaten the U.S.’s lead against China in the race to develop AI technology.  Silicon Valley has a mighty lobbying arm that has blocked meaningful technology regulation for years, and proponents of states’ regulatory rights say there’s no reason to believe state AI laws could “destroy AI progress,” as VCs and tech companies claim. Trump’s executive order, a draft of which was leaked a couple of weeks ago, would create an “AI Litigation Task Force” to challenge state AI laws in court, direct agencies to evaluate state laws deemed “onerous,” and push the Federal Communications Commission and Federal Trade Commission toward national standards that override state rules.  The Order would also give Sacks direct influence over AI policy, superseding the usual role of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, currently headed by Michael Kratsios.  “Christmas comes early for AI billionaires who keep getting exactly what they want from The White House: a massive handout that makes it that much easier for them to make massive profits for themselves with exactly zero consideration for the risks to our kids, to our safety, and to our jobs,” New York Assembly member Alex Bores, who sponsored New York’s RAISE Act, said in a statement. Attempts to block states’ power to regulate AI have been deeply unpopular on both sides of Congress. Earlier this year, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) introduced a proposal that would place a 10-year moratorium on AI legislation into the federal budget bill, but it was rejected 99-1, in a rare moment of bipartisan agreement that tech companies shouldn’t operate without oversight. And when Trump’s draft was leaked last month, several Republican politicians spoke out.  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) posted on X: “States must retain the right to regulate and make laws on AI and anything else for the benefit of their state. Federalism must be preserved.” Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) posted late last week: “I oppose stripping Florida of our ability to legislate in the best interest of the people. A ten year AI moratorium bans state regulation of AI, which would prevent FL from enacting important protections for individuals, children and families.” DeSantis has also called data centers as drains on power and water resources, as well as potential job killers.  “The rise of AI is the most significant economic and cultural shift occurring at the moment; denying the people the ability to channel these technologies in a productive way via self-government constitutes federal government overreach and lets technology companies run wild,” he said in a November X post.  Late last week, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) warned Trump against the EO, advising him to “leave AI to the states” to preserve federalism and allow local protections.  The desire to protect people from potential harms of AI technology is not unfounded. There have been several deaths by suicide following prolonged conversations with AI chatbots, and psychologists have recorded an uptick in cases of a condition they’re calling “AI psychosis.”  A bipartisan coalition of over 35 state attorneys general warned Congress last month that overriding state AI laws could have “disastrous consequences,” and more than 200 state lawmakers have issued an open letter opposing federal preemption, citing setbacks to progress on AI safety. This article has been updated with comment from Alex Bores (D-NY). "
Hinge’s new AI feature helps daters move beyond boring small talk,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/hinges-new-ai-feature-helps-daters-start-better-convos-moving-beyond-boring-small-talk/,"Many daters on Hinge are getting annoyed with matches who just like their profiles but never bother to start a conversation. It often leads to this awkward silence, putting all the pressure on one person to make the first move. Instead of coming up with something interesting to say, some just fall back on the same old lines or stick to boring small talk, like asking, “How are you?” To address this issue, Hinge unveiled “Convo Starters,” a feature powered by AI that provides personalized tips for initiating conversations.  The feature aims to inspire daters and boost their confidence when sending initial messages. When users like a profile, they’ll now see three tailored tips beneath each photo and prompt. The AI evaluates a user’s profile and generates recommendations based on the individual photos or prompts. For example, if a potential match is pictured playing chess, Hinge might suggest beginning the conversation around board games. Convo Starters was developed in response to user feedback, Hinge says. The company’s research indicated that 72% of Hinge daters are more inclined to consider someone when a like is accompanied by a message. Data from Hinge reveals that those who include a comment with their likes are twice as likely to arrange a date.  This new feature follows the launch of its AI-driven Prompt Feedback feature, which assesses user prompts and offers tailored advice aimed at improving them by urging users to elaborate and share engaging details about their lives. However, as Hinge incorporates AI features into its app, many users, especially Gen Z, are uncomfortable with the thought of using AI in their online dating experiences. A Bloomberg Intelligence survey found that Gen Z feels more uneasy about using AI for tasks such as drafting profile prompts and responding to messages than older generations do.  Hinge’s parent company, Match Group, is dedicating around $20 million to $30 million toward AI efforts. "
OpenAI boasts enterprise win days after internal ‘code red’ on Google threat,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/openai-boasts-enterprise-win-days-after-internal-code-red-on-google-threat/,"OpenAI released new data Monday showing enterprise usage of its AI tools has surged dramatically over the past year, with ChatGPT message volume growing 8x since November 2024 and workers reporting they’re saving up to an hour daily. The findings arrive a week after CEO Sam Altman sent an internal “code red” memo about the competitive threat of Google. The timing underscores OpenAI’s push to reframe its position as the enterprise AI leader, even as it faces mounting pressures. While close to 36% of U.S. businesses are ChatGPT Enterprise customers compared to 14.3% for Anthropic, per Ramp AI Index, the majority of OpenAI’s revenue still comes from consumer subscriptions — a base that’s being threatened by Google’s Gemini. OpenAI also must compete against rival AI firm Anthropic — whose revenue comes mainly from B2B sales — and, increasingly, open-weight model providers for enterprise customers. The AI giant has committed $1.4 trillion to infrastructure commitments over the next few years, making enterprise growth essential to its business model.  “If you think about it from an economic growth perspective, consumers really matter,” Ronnie Chatterji, OpenAI’s chief economist, said during a briefing. “But when you look at historically transformative technologies like the steam engine, it’s when firms adopt and scale these technologies that you really see the biggest economic benefits.” OpenAI’s new findings suggest that adoption among larger enterprises is not only growing but becoming more integrated into workflows. Employees aren’t only sending more messages — organizations using OpenAI’s API (its developer interface) are consuming 320 times more “reasoning tokens” than they were a year ago, suggesting companies are using AI for more complex problem-solving. That, or they are experimenting heavily with the new tech and burning through tokens, without necessarily getting long-term value.  That increase in reasoning tokens, which correlates with increased energy usage, could be expensive for companies and therefore not sustainable in the long term. TechCrunch has asked OpenAI about enterprise budget allocation for AI and the sustainability of this growth rate.  Beyond raw usage metrics, OpenAI is also seeing changes in how companies deploy its tools. Use of custom GPTs — which companies use to codify institutional knowledge into assistants or automate workflows —  jumped 19x this year, now accounting for 20% of enterprise messages, the report found. OpenAI pointed to digital bank customer BBVA, which it says regularly uses over 4,000 custom GPTs. “It shows you how much people are really able to take this powerful technology and start to customize it to the things that are useful to them,” said Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer, during the briefing. These integrations have led to meaningful time savings, according to OpenAI. Participants reported saving 40 to 60 minutes per day with OpenAI’s enterprise products — though that may not include time spent learning the systems, prompting, or correcting AI output.  The report found that enterprise workers are also increasingly leveraging AI tools to expand their own capabilities. Three quarters of those surveyed say AI enables them to do things, including technical tasks, they couldn’t do before. OpenAI reported a 36% increase in coding-related messages outside of engineering, IT, and research teams.  While OpenAI drove home the idea that its technology is democratizing access to skills, it’s important to note that more vibe coding could lead to more security vulnerabilities and other flaws. When asked about this, Lightcap pointed to OpenAI’s recent release of its agentic security researcher Aardvark, which is in private beta, as a potential way to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and exploits.  OpenAI’s report also found that even the most active ChatGPT Enterprise users aren’t using the most advanced tools available to them, like data analysis, reasoning, or search. During the briefing, Lightcap mused that this was because fully adopting AI systems requires a mindset shift and deeper integration with enterprise data and processes. Adoption of advanced features will take time, he said, as companies retool workflows to better understand what’s possible.  Lightcap and Chatterji also stressed a report finding that showed a “growing divide in AI adoption,” with some “frontier” workers using more tools more often to save more time than the “laggards.” “There are firms that still very much see these systems as a piece of software, something I can buy and give to my teams and that’s kind of the end of it,” Lightcap said. “And then there are companies that are really starting to embrace it, almost more like an operating system. It’s basically a re-platforming of a lot of the company’s operations.” OpenAI’s leadership — which certainly feels the pressure of the firm’s $1.4 trillion in infrastructure commitments — framed this as an opportunity for laggards to catch up. For workers training AI systems to replicate their work, “catching up” might feel more like a countdown."
OpenAI says it’s turned off app suggestions that look like ads,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/07/openai-says-its-turned-off-app-suggestions-that-look-like-ads/,"While OpenAI continues to insist that there are currently no ads — or tests for advertising — live in ChatGPT, the company’s chief research officer Mark Chen also acknowledged that the company “fell short” with recent promotional messages and is working to improve the experience. Chen and other OpenAI executives were responding to posts from ChatGPT’s paying subscribers who complained about seeing promotional messages for companies like Peloton and Target. In response, the company said it was only testing ways to show apps built on the ChatGPT app platform that it announced in October, with “no financial component” to those suggestions. (One of the users who’d complained initially about the ads responded skeptically, writing, “Bruhhh… Don’t insult your paying users.”) I'm in ChatGPT (paid Plus subscription), asking about Windows BitLockerand it's F-ing showing me ADS TO SHOP AT TARGET.Yeah, screw this. Lose all your users. pic.twitter.com/2Z5AG8pnlJ Similarly, ChatGPT head Nick Turley posted Friday that he was “seeing lots of confusion about ads rumors in ChatGPT.” “There are no live tests for ads – any screenshots you’ve seen are either not real or not ads,” Turley wrote. “If we do pursue ads, we’ll take a thoughtful approach. People trust ChatGPT and anything we do will be designed to respect that.” Earlier that same day, however, Chen responded in a more apologetic tone, acknowledging that the controversy isn’t just a matter of user confusion. “I agree that anything that feels like an ad needs to be handled with care, and we fell short,” he wrote. “We’ve turned off this kind of suggestion while we improve the model’s precision. We’re also looking at better controls so you can dial this down or off if you don’t find it helpful.” Earlier this year, former Instacart and Facebook executive Fidji Sumo joined OpenAI as CEO of Applications and was widely expected to build up the company’s advertising business. However, The Wall Street Journal reported this week that a recent memo from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman declared a “code red,” prioritizing work to improve the quality of ChatGPT and pushing back other products, including advertising."
"Pat Gelsinger wants to save Moore’s Law, with a little help from the Feds",https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/06/pat-gelsinger-wants-to-save-moores-law-with-a-little-help-from-the-feds/,"A year after being pushed out of Intel, Pat Gelsinger is still waking up at 4 a.m., still in the thick of the semiconductor wars — just on a different battlefield. Now a general partner at venture firm Playground Global, he’s working with 10 startups. But one portfolio company has captured an outsized share of his attention: xLight, a semiconductor startup that last Monday announced it has struck a preliminary deal for up to $150 million from the U.S. Commerce Department, with the government set to become a meaningful shareholder. It’s a nice feather in the cap of Gelsinger, who spent 35 years across two stints at Intel before the board showed him the door late last year owing to a lack of confidence in his turnaround plans. But the xLight deal is also shining a spotlight on a trend that’s making people in Silicon Valley quietly uncomfortable: the Trump administration taking equity stakes in strategically important companies. “What the hell happened to free enterprise?” California Governor Gavin Newsom asked at a speaking event this week, capturing the unease that’s rippling through an industry that has long prided itself on its free-market principles. Speaking at one of TechCrunch’s StrictlyVC events at Playground Global, Gelsinger — who is xLight’s executive chairman — seemed unbothered by the philosophical debate. He’s more focused on his bet that xLight can solve what he sees as the semiconductor industry’s biggest bottleneck: lithography, the process of etching microscopic patterns onto silicon wafers. The startup is developing massive “free electron lasers” powered by particle accelerators that could revolutionize chip manufacturing. If the technology works at scale, that is. “You know, I have this long-term mission to continue to see Moore’s Law in the semiconductor industry,” Gelsinger said, referencing the decades-old principle that computing power should double every two years. “We think this is the technology that will wake up Moore’s Law.” The xLight deal is the first Chips and Science Act award under Trump’s second term, using funding earmarked for early-stage companies with promising technologies. Notably, the deal is currently at the letter of intent stage, meaning it’s not finalized and details could still change. When pressed on whether the funding could end up being double the announced amount — or potentially not materialize at all — Gelsinger was candid. “We’ve agreed in principle on the terms, but like any of these contracts, there’s still work to get done,” he said. The technology xLight is pursuing is pretty serious in both scale and ambition. The company plans to build machines roughly 100 meters by 50 meters — about the size of a football field — that will sit outside semiconductor fabrication plants. These free electron lasers would generate extreme ultraviolet light at wavelengths as precise as 2 nanometers, far more powerful than the 13.5 nanometer wavelengths currently used by ASML, the Dutch giant that utterly dominates the EUV lithography market. “About half of the capital goes into lithography,” Gelsinger explained of the entire semiconductor industry. “In the middle of a lithography machine is light . . . [and] this ability to keep innovating for shorter wavelength, higher power light is the essence of being able to continue to innovate for more advanced semiconductors. Leading xLight is Nicholas Kelez, whose background is unusual for the semiconductor world. Before founding xLight, Kelez led quantum computer development efforts at PsiQuantum (a Playground Global portfolio company) and spent two decades building large-scale X-ray science facilities at national labs including SLAC and Lawrence Berkeley, where he was chief engineer for the Linac Coherent Light Source. So why is this viable now when ASML abandoned a similar approach almost a decade ago? “The difference was the technology wasn’t as mature,” explained Kelez, who was speaking at the event alongside Gelsinger. Back then, only a handful of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines existed, and the industry had already sunk tens of billions into the incumbent technology. “It just wasn’t the time to take on something completely new and orthogonal.” Now, with EUV ubiquitous in leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing and existing light source technology hitting its limits, the timing looks better. The key innovation, according to Kelez, is treating light like a utility rather than building it into each machine. “We go away from building an integrated light source with the tool, which is what [ASML does] now and that fundamentally constrains you to make it smaller and less powerful,” he said. And instead, “We treat light the same way you treat electrical power or HVAC. We build outside the fab at utility scale and then distribute in.” The company is aiming to produce its first silicon wafers by 2028 and have its first commercial system online by 2029. There are, naturally, hurdles, though right now, competing with ASML directly does not appear to be one of them. In fact, the very opposite is true. “We’re working very closely with them to basically design how we integrate with an ASML scanner,” Kelez said. “So we’re working with both them, as well as their providers, [like] Zeiss, who does their optics.” When asked whether Intel or other major chipmakers have committed to purchasing xLight’s technology, Gelsinger said they have not: “Nobody has committed yet, but the work is going on with everybody on the list that you would expect, and we’re having intense conversations with all of them.” Meanwhile, the competitive landscape is heating up. In October, Substrate — a semiconductor manufacturing startup backed by Peter Thiel — announced it raised $100 million to develop U.S. chip fabs, including an EUV tool that sounds awfully similar to xLight’s approach. Gelsinger doesn’t see them as direct competition though. “If Substrate is successful, they could be a customer for us,” he said, suggesting that Substrate is focused on building a full-stack lithography scanner that would ultimately need a free electron laser, which is exactly what xLight is developing. Gelsinger’s relationship with the Trump administration adds another layer to the story. He brought up xLight to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick back in February, before Lutnick was confirmed. At that point, Kelez says, he’d already spent more than a year pitching xLight to the government as a way to bring chip manufacturing back to the U.S., but the new arrangement has drawn criticism from some who view the administration’s approach as overreach. Gelsinger is unapologetic, framing it as necessary for national competitiveness. “I measure it by the results,” he said. “Does it drive the results that we want and that we need to reinvigorate our industrial policies? Many of our competitive countries don’t have such debates. They’re moving forward with the policies that are necessary to accomplish their competitive outcomes.” He pointed to energy policy as another example. “How many nuclear reactors are being built in the U.S. today? Zero. How many being built in China today? Thirty-nine. Energy policy in a digital AI economy equals the economic capacity of the nation.” For xLight, the government stake comes with minimal strings attached. The Commerce Department won’t have veto rights or a board seat, says Kelez (pictured above, right, with Gelsinger). No information rights, nothing, Gelsinger adds. “It’s a minority investment, in a non-governing way, but it also says we need this company to succeed for national interest.” xLight has raised $40 million from investors including Playground Global and is planning another fundraising round next month, in January. Unlike fusion or quantum computing startups that need billions, Kelez said xLight’s path is more manageable. “This is not fusion or quantum,” he said. “We don’t need billions.” The company also signed a letter of intent with New York to build its first machine at the New York CREATE site near Albany, though that agreement also needs finalization. For Gelsinger, xLight is clearly more than just another portfolio company. It’s a chance to cement his relevance in the semiconductor industry that he helped build, even if his methods put him at odds with Silicon Valley’s traditional ethos. Asked about navigating his principles in the current political environment, Gelsinger retreated to a more technocratic view of corporate leadership — one where the money is from the U.S. government, administrations are temporary, and CEOs must remain above the fray. “CEOs and companies should neither be Republican or Democrat,” he said. “Your job is to accomplish the business objective, serve your investors, serve your shareholders. That is your objective. And as a result, you need to be able to figure out what policies are beneficial on the R side or what policies are beneficial in the D side, and be able to navigate through them.” He added separately of that $150 million from the Trump administration, “Taxpayers will do well.” When asked if working across 10 startups is enough for someone who used to run Intel, Gelsinger was emphatic: “Absolutely. The idea that I can now influence across such a wide range of technologies — I’m a deep tech guy at the core of who I am. My mind is so stretched here, and I’m just grateful that the Playground team would have me to join them and let me make them smarter and be a rookie venture capitalist.” He paused, then added with a grin: “And I gave my wife back her weekends.” It’s a nice thought, though anyone who knows Gelsinger’s reputation as a workaholic might wonder how long that arrangement will last.

"Ex-Googler’s Yoodli triples valuation to $300M+ with AI built to assist, not replace, people",https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/ex-googlers-yoodli-triples-valuation-to-300m-with-ai-built-to-assist-not-replace-people/,"Yoodli, an AI-powered communication training startup, has reached a valuation of more than $300 million — more than triple its level six months ago — as it builds technology meant to assist people rather than replace them with machines. The valuation increase follows Yoodli’s $40 million Series B round, led by WestBridge Capital with participation from Neotribe and Madrona. It comes after a $13.7 million Series A round announced in May, bringing the startup’s total funding to nearly $60 million. As AI tools spread into workplaces and fuel fears of automation, Yoodli positions itself differently. The four-year-old, Seattle-based startup uses AI to run simulated scenarios — including sales calls, leadership coaching, interviews, and feedback sessions — and provides users with structured, repeatable practice to improve their speaking skills. Varun Puri (pictured above, right), who previously worked at Google’s X division and handled special projects for Sergey Brin, co-founded Yoodli with former Apple engineer Esha Joshi (pictured above, left) in 2021. He became aware of communication challenges after moving to the U.S. at 18 and seeing how difficulty expressing ideas or speaking confidently affected students and young professionals from countries such as India — himself included — Puri said in an interview. Initially, Yoodli was meant to help people practice public speaking — a skill two out of three people struggle with, Puri told TechCrunch, citing internal data. However, the startup soon saw users turning to the platform for interview preparation, sales pitches, and difficult conversations. That shift pushed Yoodli from a consumer-focused product to enterprise training, and it now offers AI role-plays and experiential learning tools for go-to-market enablement, partner certification, and management coaching. “In the old world, companies would be training people using static, long-form content or passive videos that we’d all watch at 4x-5x speed, just to get the thing done,” said Puri. “But that doesn’t actually mean you’ve learned it.” Companies including Google, Snowflake, Databricks, RingCentral, and Sandler Sales use Yoodli for employee or partner training. The startup also sells its platform to coaching firms such as Franklin Covey and LHH, which can tailor the system to their own methodology and training frameworks, Puri stated. He added that the tool is not designed to replace human coaches but to keep a human in the loop delivering personalized guidance. “I philosophically believe that AI can get you, let’s call it from a zero to an eight or a zero to nine,” said Puri. “But the pure essence of who you are and how you show up, and your authenticity and vulnerability that a human gives you feedback on will always exist.” The platform works with multiple large language models, meaning users can run it with models such as Google’s Gemini or OpenAI’s GPT based on their preference. Enterprises can also embed it into their existing software, or users can access it directly through a web browser. The AI supports most major languages, including Korean, Japanese, French, Canadian French, and a list of Indian languages. Yoodli does not offer a dedicated mobile app, a decision Puri said was made to avoid adding extra steps for users during training sessions. Puri did not disclose how many people use the platform but said most of Yoodli’s revenue now comes from enterprise customers. He added that between the Series A and B rounds, Yoodli saw a 50% increase in the number of role-plays run on the platform and in the total time users spent practicing. The startup also said it grew its average recurring revenue by 900% over the last 12 months, though it did not provide specific figures. Yoodli had not planned to raise more funding so soon after its last round but saw unanticipated investor interest, with WestBridge leading the latest raise, Puri said. He noted that strong performance metrics, key customers, and senior hires helped attract investors. The startup has recently hired former Tableau and Salesforce executive Josh Vitello as chief revenue officer (CRO), former Remitly CFO Andy Larson as CFO, and former Tableau chief product officer (CPO) Padmashree Koneti as CPO. Yoodli is not alone in the market for AI-based communication tools, but Puri told TechCrunch the startup differentiates itself through deep customization and a focus on specific training verticals, allowing companies to tailor the system to their use cases and coaching methods. The Seattle-headquartered startup has about 40 employees. Puri said the latest funding will be used to expand Yoodli’s AI coaching, analytics, and personalization tools, and to grow its presence in enterprise learning and professional development. The company also plans to hire across product, AI research, and customer success, and to expand into markets in the Asia-Pacific region while deepening its footprint in the U.S. "
Sources: AI synthetic research startup Aaru raised a Series A at a $1B ‘headline’ valuation,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/ai-synthetic-research-startup-aaru-raised-a-series-a-at-a-1b-headline-valuation/,"Aaru, a startup that provides near-instant customer research by using AI to simulate user behavior, has raised a Series A led by Redpoint Ventures, according to three people familiar with the deal. The funding round included different valuation tiers, these people said. Although some equity was acquired at a $1 billion valuation, a lower valuation for other investors resulted in a blended valuation below $1 billion, according to people familiar with the deal. Multi-tier valuations within the same round are an unusual mechanism in venture capital, but investors say they are becoming increasingly common for desirable AI startups in the current market. This approach allows the company to report a higher “headline” valuation while simultaneously offering better terms to specific investors. Aaru and Redpoint Ventures didn’t respond to a request for comment. The exact round size couldn’t be learned, but one person said that it is above $50 million. Another source said that the startup is growing quickly, but its annual recurring revenue (ARR) is still below $10 million. Aaru was founded in March 2024 by Cameron Fink, Ned Koh, and John Kessler, according to their LinkedIn profiles. The startup’s prediction model generates thousands of AI agents that simulate human behavior using public and proprietary data. Aaru replaces traditional market research methods, which generally include surveys and focus groups, by using agents to predict how groups in specific demographics or geographies will respond to future events.   The company’s customer partners include Accenture, EY, Interpublic Group, and political campaigns. Last year, Aaru AI’s polling methodology accurately predicted the outcome of the New York Democratic primary, according to reporting by Semafor. Aaru competes with other social simulation startups, including CulturePulse and Simile, as well as startups that apply AI to query humans about their product preferences, such as Listen Labs, Keplar, and Outset. The startup raised an undisclosed amount of seed and pre-seed capital from investors, including A*, Abstract Ventures, Felicis, General Catalyst, Accenture Ventures, and Z Fellows, according to people familiar with the deal and PitchBook data.

Meta acquires AI device startup Limitless,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/meta-acquires-ai-device-startup-limitless/,"Limitless, the AI startup formerly known as Rewind, has been acquired by Meta, the company announced Friday on its website. The company, which made an AI-powered pendant to record your conversations, says it will no longer sell its hardware devices and will maintain support for its existing customers for a year. Customers will no longer have to pay a subscription fee and will be moved to the Unlimited Plan for the time being. Other functionality will be wound down, including its non-pendant software “Rewind,” which recorded users’ desktop activity and turned it into a searchable record. The startup, founded by Brett Bejcek and Dan Siroker, the co-founder and former chief executive of Optimizely, pivoted to become an AI device maker last year, offering its Limitless pendant for $99. The wearable could attach to your shirt like a wireless mic or be worn like a necklace. The device is one of several AI hardware devices on the market, including another (not very well-received) AI pendant known as Friend. According to Limitless’ announcement, the company shares in Meta’s vision to “bring personal superintelligence to everyone,” which includes building AI-enabled wearables. (Meta is focused for now on AR/AI glasses, like its Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta, and its in-lens AI glasses, the Meta Ray-Ban Display.) Limitless said it will help bring that vision to life — which likely means supporting Meta’s existing products, not helping Meta add an AI pendant to its lineup. The company hinted that the increased competition in the market made it difficult for it to compete, especially as the larger players like OpenAI and Meta are developing their own hardware devices, too. “When we started Limitless five years ago, the world was very different,” wrote Siroker in the announcement. “AI was a pipe dream to many. Hardware startups were considered unfundable, and a business that did both AI and hardware would have been considered ludicrous. But today is different. The world has changed. We’re no longer working on a weird fringe idea. We’re building a future that now seems inevitable. We’re not alone.” Meta shared the following statement with TechCrunch via email: “We’re excited that Limitless will be joining Meta to help accelerate our work to build AI-enabled wearables.” The tech giant didn’t share further information about its plans, beyond noting that the team will work in the wearables organization of Reality Labs. Limitless will offer its customers a way to export their data, the company said, or users can choose to delete their data from within the app. The startup had raised more than $33 million in funding from investors, including a16z, First Round Capital, and NEA.

"ChatGPT’s user growth has slowed, report finds",https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/chatgpts-user-growth-has-slowed-report-finds/,"ChatGPT’s growth is starting to taper off, according to new data from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower. Today, the OpenAI-owned AI chatbot remains the leader in the space, accounting for 50% of global downloads on mobile devices and 55% of the global monthly active users. However, Google’s Gemini has begun to outpace ChatGPT in terms of download growth, growth of monthly active users, and growth of time spent in app, the firm found. Over time, that increased pace of adoption could help Gemini narrow the gap with ChatGPT. That’s something OpenAI is now worried about, as its recent “code red” memo indicated. The missive, penned by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, instructed staff to focus on improving the company’s AI products, particularly in areas like personalization, reliability, image generation, and more. When looking at the recent data, it’s clear the race is not over yet: Both ChatGPT and Gemini continue to see sizable growth. ChatGPT has seen its global monthly active users climb by 180% year-over-year as of November 2025, while Gemini’s monthly active users are up 170%. But the new data indicates that ChatGPT’s global monthly active users only grew by around 6% from August to November, to reach roughly 810 million. (The monthly active user numbers in the above chart are rounded, the firm notes.) This figure could suggest the AI chatbot is nearing market saturation, Sensor Tower says. Meanwhile, Google Gemini’s global monthly active users jumped by around 30% during the same time frame, as the release of its new image generation model, Nano Banana, drove increased adoption. In addition, the report noted that around two times more U.S. Android users now engage with Gemini directly through the Android operating system compared with using the standalone Gemini mobile app. This could provide Google with a competitive advantage in the global market, where Android dominates, as it means Gemini isn’t constrained to only being used within a mobile app or web interface. Gemini is also increasing its share of the overall AI chatbot market when compared across all top apps like ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, Perplexity, and Grok. Over the past seven months (May-November 2025), Gemini increased its share of global monthly active users by three percentage points, the firm estimates. But ChatGPT saw its share of global monthly active users drop three percentage points over the past four months (August-November 2025), by comparison. Challenges from Perplexity and Claude may also be impacting ChatGPT, as both rivals saw triple-digit growth for their respective chatbots in 2025, with the former up 370% year-over-year, and the latter up 190%. ChatGPT also saw its global downloads grow by 85% year-over-year as of November, but this lagged the overall cohort’s average growth of 110%. Perplexity and Gemini saw the largest growth, up 215% and 190% year-over-year, respectively. Finally, Gemini app users’ time spent in the app has more than doubled over the past few months, Sensor Tower said. As of November, Gemini users were spending 11 minutes per day in the app, up 120% from March. This is likely due to the popularity of its image generation model, Nano Banana, in September. ChatGPT’s users’ daily time spent only increased by 6% during the same time frame. Plus, ChatGPT users’ time spent was down 10% in November, compared with July. While the current data indicates Google could be catching up with the market leader, much of its recent gains have to do with the success of Nano Banana. OpenAI could speed up growth again with the release of its own new products, if they make a similar impact."

AWS re:Invent was an all-in pitch for AI. Customers might not be ready.,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/aws-reinvent-was-an-all-in-pitch-for-ai-customers-might-not-be-ready/,"If Amazon Web Services’ annual re:Invent tech conference proves anything, it’s that the cloud infrastructure player is going all in on AI. AWS made dozens of announcements, from new AI agents and updated large language models, to products with LLM and agent-building capabilities. AI for enterprise was everywhere. But are its customers just as eager? AWS CEO Matt Garman acknowledged during his keynote that enterprises haven’t seen a return on AI investment yet. He thinks that’s about to change — and fast. “I believe that the advent of AI agents has brought us to an inflection point in AI’s trajectory,” Garman said. “It’s turning from a technical wonder into something that delivers us real value. This change is going to have as much impact on your business as the internet or the cloud.” While analysts told TechCrunch they were impressed by some of AWS’ tech announcements this week, they aren’t sure it’s enough to move the needle on enterprise AI adoption or change AWS’ position in the AI race. AWS is one of the market leaders when it comes to cloud infrastructure; the same can’t be said for its enterprise AI offerings. Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google hold a commanding lead when it comes to enterprise market share for actual AI models. AWS does have the advantage of having everything in house, including infrastructure and its own AI training chips. Naveen Chhabra, a principal analyst at Forrester, told TechCrunch over email that while AWS announced a lot of cool new technology, it doesn’t change the fact that many enterprises aren’t ready to adopt AI. “AWS AI announcements show that AWS is thinking ahead and maybe far too ahead,” Chhabra wrote. “Most enterprises are still piloting AI projects and are rarely at the levels of maturity AWS expects them to be to take advantage of the offerings that come out of these announcements.” A widely cited MIT study from August found that 95% of enterprises aren’t seeing a return on investment from AI. Ethan Feller, an equity strategist at Zacks Investment Research, told TechCrunch in a phone interview that the new Nova AI models, agents, and model-building capabilities weren’t what stood out to him as interesting from this week — despite these being the products AWS hyped the most. Instead, it was the infrastructure announcements. “The AWS AI factory is really compelling,” Feller said about a new initiative that allows customers to run AWS AI in their own data centers. “AWS is a huge player in where the models are being run and is dominant in the cloud industry. I think that is where Amazon’s expertise really lies. It’s a good thing to double down on where they have expertise.” Feller likes that AWS is looking to make a vertical AI play, but he thinks it may make more sense to do so through partnerships with other AI players like Anthropic and Nvidia as opposed to using all of their own AI technology. Despite all of this, AWS is still well-positioned to carve out market share in the AI sector, while continuing to grow its core businesses. AWS’ position as an industry-leading cloud provider means it has a solid business foundation despite what happens in the AI market because it provides the rails for the industry’s technology — regardless of what the AI trend of the moment is. If the AI industry ends up being the bubble some say it is, AWS, which recorded $11.4 billion in operating income in the third quarter, will likely be less affected by a negative change in AI market conditions than its peers. This gives AWS room to experiment and iterate on what its place in the AI market could look like down the road. That’s why even if enterprises aren’t ready for the tech they release today, AWS should keep working to improve it. Follow along with all of TechCrunch’s coverage of the annual enterprise tech event here, and see all the announcements you may have missed thus far here."
The New York Times is suing Perplexity for copyright infringement,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/the-new-york-times-is-suing-perplexity-for-copyright-infringement/,"The New York Times filed suit Friday against AI search startup Perplexity for copyright infringement, its second lawsuit against an AI company. The Times joins several media outlets suing Perplexity, including the Chicago Tribune, which also filed suit this week. The Times’ suit claims that “Perplexity provides commercial products to its own users that substitute” for the outlet, “without permission or remuneration.”  The lawsuit — filed even as several publishers, including The Times, negotiate deals with AI firms — is part of the same, ongoing years-long strategy. Recognizing the AI tide cannot be stopped, publishers use lawsuits as leverage in negotiations in the hopes of forcing AI companies to formally license content in ways that compensate creators and maintain the economic viability of original journalism. Perplexity tried to address compensation demands by launching a Publishers’ Program last year, which offers participating outlets like Gannett, TIME, Fortune and the Los Angeles Times a share of ad revenue. In August, Perplexity also launched Comet Plus, allocating 80% of its $5 monthly fee to participating publishers, and recently struck a multi-year licensing deal with Getty Images. “While we believe in the ethical and responsible use and development of AI, we firmly object to Perplexity’s unlicensed use of our content to develop and promote their products,” Graham James, a spokesperson for The Times, said in a statement. “We will continue to work to hold companies accountable that refuse to recognize the value of our work.” Similar to the Tribune’s suit, the Times takes issue with Perplexity’s method for answering user queries by gathering information from websites and databases to generate responses via its retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) products, like its chatbots and Comet browser AI assistant.  “Perplexity then repackages the original content in written responses to users,” the suit reads. “Those responses, or outputs, often are verbatim or near-verbatim reproductions, summaries, or abridgments of the original content, including The Times’s copyrighted works.”   Or, as James put it in his statement,  “RAG allows Perplexity to crawl the internet and steal content from behind our paywall and deliver it to its customers in real time. That content should only be accessible to our paying subscribers.” The Times also claims Perplexity’s search engine has hallucinated information and falsely attributed it to the outlet, which damages its brand. “Publishers have been suing new tech companies for a hundred years, starting with radio, TV, the internet, social media, and now AI,” Jesse Dwyer, Perplexity’s head of communications, told TechCrunch. “Fortunately it’s never worked, or we’d all be talking about this by telegraph.” (Publishers have, at times, won or shaped major legal battles over new technologies, resulting in settlements, licensing regimes, and court precedents.) The lawsuit comes just over a year after The Times sent a cease and desist letter to Perplexity demanding it stop using its content for summaries and other output. The outlet claims it has contacted Perplexity several times over the past 18 months to stop using its content unless an agreement could be negotiated. This isn’t the first fight The Times has picked with an AI firm. The Times is also suing OpenAI and its backer Microsoft, claiming the two trained their AI systems with millions of the outlet’s articles without offering compensation. OpenAI has argued that its use of publicly available data for AI training constitutes “fair use,” and has shot its own accusations at the Times, claiming the outlet manipulated ChatGPT to find evidence.  That case is still ongoing, but a similar lawsuit directed against OpenAI competitor Anthropic could set a precedent in regards to fair use for training AI systems going forward. In that suit, in which authors and publishers sued the AI firm for using pirated books to train its models, the court ruled that while lawfully acquired books might be a safe fair use application, pirated ones infringe on copyrights. Anthropic agreed to a $1.5 billion settlement.  The Times’ lawsuit adds to mounting legal pressure on Perplexity. Last year, News Corp — which owns outlets like The Wall Street Journal, Barron’s, and the New York Post — made similar claims against Perplexity. That list grew in 2025 to also include Encyclopedia Britannica and Merriam-Webster, Nikkei, Asahi Shimbun, and Reddit. Other outlets, including Wired and Forbes, have accused Perplexity of plagiarism and unethically crawling and scraping content from websites that have explicitly indicated they don’t want to be scraped. The latter claim is one that internet infrastructure provider Cloudflare recently confirmed.  In its suit, The Times is asking the courts to make Perplexity pay for the harm allegedly caused and ban the startup from continuing to use its content.  The Times is clearly not above working with AI firms that compensate for its reporters’ work. The outlet earlier this year struck a multi-year deal with Amazon to license its content to train the tech giant’s AI models. Several other publishers and media companies have signed licensing deals with AI firms to use their content for training and to feature in chatbot responses. OpenAI has inked deals with Associated Press, Axel Springer, Vox Media, The Atlantic, and more.   This article has been updated with comment from Perplexity."
Meta signs commercial AI data agreements with publishers to offer real-time news on Meta AI,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/meta-signs-commercial-ai-data-agreements-with-publishers-to-offer-real-time-news-on-meta-ai/,"Meta has signed commercial AI data agreements with news publishers to offer real-time global, entertainment, and breaking news on Meta AI, its AI chatbot. Now, when users ask Meta AI news-related questions, it will surface information and links that draw from different content sources to help users discover timely and relevant content, the company announced on Friday. These responses will also include links to articles, so users can visit publishers’ websites to learn more. The company says this will allow its partners to reach new audiences. Meta is partnering with CNN, Fox News, Fox Sports, Le Monde Group, the People Inc. portfolio of media brands, The Daily Caller, The Washington Examiner, and USA Today. The company plans to add new partnerships in the future. The move comes as Meta shifted away from making its platforms hubs for news. For example, it killed Facebook’s “News” tab in 2024. Additionally, Meta stopped compensating news publishers in 2022, but is now doing so to help supercharge its AI chatbot with real-time access to news. “We’re committed to making Meta AI more responsive, accurate, and balanced,” Meta wrote in the blog post. “Real-time events can be challenging for current AI systems to keep up with, but by integrating more and different types of news sources, our aim is to improve Meta AI’s ability to deliver timely and relevant content and information with a wide variety of viewpoints and content types.” The company is looking to attract more users to its AI chatbot as it faces increasing competition from rivals. Meta is also looking to stay relevant in the AI race after the controversial release of Llama 4, which was met with complaints of poor performance earlier this year. Meta AI is available in over 200 countries and can be accessed through the company’s apps, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, as well as through the standalone Meta AI app."
Chicago Tribune sues Perplexity,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/chicago-tribune-sues-perplexity/,"The Chicago Tribune filed a lawsuit against AI search engine Perplexity on Thursday alleging copyright infringement. The suit, seen by TechCrunch, was filed in a federal court in New York. The Tribune alleges that its lawyers contacted Perplexity in mid-October asking if the AI search engine was using its content, according to the complaint. Perplexity’s lawyers replied it did not train models with the Tribune’s work but that it “may receive non-verbatim factual summaries,” the lawsuit claims. The Tribune’s lawyers, however, argue that Perplexity is delivering Tribune content verbatim. Interestingly, the newspaper’s lawyers are also calling out Perplexity’s retrieval augmented generation (RAG) as a culprit. RAG is a method used to limit hallucinations by having the model only use an accurate or verified data source. The Tribune argues that Perplexity is using the newspaper’s content in its RAG systems, scraped without permission. Plus, it alleges the Perplexity’s Comet browser is bypassing the paper’s paywall to deliver detailed summaries of those articles. The Tribune is one of 17 news publications from MediaNews Group and Tribune Publishing that sued OpenAI and Microsoft over model training material: eight sued in April and another nine sued in November. Those suit are ongoing. While creators have filed many lawsuits against model makers over using their work for model training, we’ll have to see if the courts weigh in about the legal liabilities of RAG as well. Perplexity did not immediately respond to the Chicago Tribune’s story about its own lawsuit, nor to TechCrunch’s request for comment. Perplexity is facing other such suits. Reddit filed one in October. Dow Jones is also suing. Last month, while Amazon didn’t sue, it did threaten to by sending a cease-and-desist letter over AI browser shopping. Correction: This article originally misstated the number publications jointly suing OpenAI and Microsoft across two lawsuits. Those figures have been clarified.  "
All the biggest news from AWS’ big tech show re:Invent 2025,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/all-the-biggest-news-from-aws-big-tech-show-reinvent-2025/,"Amazon Web Services’ annual tech conference AWS re:Invent has wrapped. And the singular message, amid a deluge of product news and keynotes, was AI for the enterprise. This year it was all about upgrades that give customers greater control to customize AI agents, including one that AWS claims can learn from you and then work independently for days. Amazon CTO Dr. Werner Vogels capped off the final night with a keynote aimed at lifting up developers and assuaging any fears that AI is coming for engineering jobs. AWS re:Invent 2025, which runs through December 5, started with a keynote from AWS CEO Matt Garman, who leaned into the idea that AI agents can unlock the “true value” of AI. “AI assistants are starting to give way to AI agents that can perform tasks and automate on your behalf,” he said during the December 2 keynote. “This is where we’re starting to see material business returns from your AI investments.” On December 3, the conference pressed on with its AI agents messaging, as well as deeper dives into customer stories. Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of Agentic AI at AWS, gave one of the keynote talks. To say he was bullish is perhaps understating the vibe. “We are living in times of great change,” Sivasubramanian said during the talk. “For the first time in history, we can describe what we want to accomplish in natural language, and agents generate the plan. They write the code, call the necessary tools, and execute the complete solution. Agents give you the freedom to build without limits, accelerating how quickly you can go from idea to impact in a big way.” While AI agent news promises to be a persistent presence throughout AWS re:Invent 2025, there were other announcements, too. Here is a roundup of the ones that got our attention. TechCrunch will update this article, with the newest insights at the top, through the end of AWS re:Invent. Be sure to check back. Amazon CTO Werner Vogels had the closing keynote of the conference — and it looks like this will be his last one. “This is my final re:Invent keynote,” he said, then quickly added he is not leaving the company. “I’m not leaving Amazon or anything like that, but I think that after 14 re:Invents you guys are owed young, fresh, new voices.” Vogels then spent more than an hour talking to a packed room before ending with a “Werner, out” and a literal mic drop. Vogels spent much of the closing keynote talking about AI and its role in the future, including the looming threat that it will take away jobs. “Will AI take my job? Maybe,” Vogels asked and answered, before noting that some tasks will be automated, and some skills will become obsolete. “So maybe we should rephrase and reframe this question. Will AI make me obsolete? Absolutely not, if you evolve.” AWS unveiled its Graviton5 CPU on Thursday, the next-generation chip that the company promises will be its highest performing, most efficient yet. The Graviton5 contains 192 processor cores, a dense and efficient design that AWS says reduces the distance data must travel between cores. That helps cut inter-core communication latency by up to 33% while increasing bandwidth, the company said.  AWS announced more tools for enterprise customers to create their own models. Specifically, AWS said it is adding new capabilities for both Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker AI to make building custom LLMs easier. For instance, AWS is bringing serverless model customization to SageMaker, which allows developers to start building a model without needing to think about compute resources or infrastructure. The serverless model customization can be accessed through either a self-guided path or by prompting an AI agent.AWS also announced Reinforcement Fine Tuning in Bedrock, which allows developers to choose a preset workflow or reward system and have Bedrock run their customization process automatically from start to finish. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy took to social media platform X to expound on AWS chief Matt Garman’s keynote speech. The message: The current generation of its Nvidia-competitor AI chip Trainium2 is already bringing in loads of cash. His comments were tied to the reveal of its next-generation chip, Trainium3, and meant to forecast a promising revenue future for the product. Tucked among the dozens of announcements is one item that is already getting cheers: Discounts. Specifically, AWS said it was launching Database Savings Plans, which help customers reduce database costs by up to 35% when they commit to a consistent amount of usage ($/hour) over a one-year term. The company said the savings will automatically apply each hour to eligible usage across supported database services, and any additional usage beyond the commitment is billed at on-demand rates. Corey Quinn, chief cloud economist at Duckbill, summed it up well in his blog post, “Six years of complaining finally pays off.” Is there any way for another AI coding tool to win the hearts of startup founders? Amazon hopes a year’s worth of credits, for free, will do the trick for its offering, Kiro. The company will be giving away credits to Kiro Pro+ to qualified startups that apply for the deal before the end of the month. However, only early-stage startups in certain countries are eligible. AWS introduced a new version of its AI training chip called Trainium3 along with an AI system called UltraServer that runs it. The TL;DR: This upgraded chip comes with some impressive specs, including a promise of up to 4x performance gains for both AI training and inference while lowering energy use by 40%. AWS also provided a teaser. The company already has Trainium4 in development, which will be able to work with Nvidia’s chips. AWS announced new features in its AgentCore AI agent building platform. One feature of note is Policy in AgentCore, which gives developers the ability to more easily set boundaries for AI agents. AWS also announced that agents will now be able to log and remember things about their users. Plus it announced that it will help its customers evaluate agents through 13 prebuilt evaluation systems. AWS announced three new AI agents (there is that term again) called “Frontier agents,” including one called “Kiro autonomous agent” that writes code and is designed to learn how a team likes to work so it can operate largely on its own for hours or days. Another of these new agents handles security processes like code reviews, and the third does DevOps tasks such as preventing incidents when pushing new code live. Preview versions of the agents are available now. AWS is rolling out four new AI models within its Nova AI model family — three of which are text generating and one that can create text and images. The company also announced a new service called Nova Forge that allows AWS cloud customers to access pre-trained, mid-trained, or post-trained models that they can then top off by training on their own proprietary data. AWS’s big pitch is flexibility and customization. The ride-hailing company was among many AWS customers that piped up during the event to share their success stories and evidence of how products affected their business. Lyft is using Anthropic’s Claude model via Amazon Bedrock to create an AI agent that handles driver and rider questions and issues. The company said this AI agent has reduced average resolution time by 87%. Lyft also said it has seen a 70% increase in driver usage of the AI agent this year. Amazon also announced “AI Factories” that allow big corporations and governments to run AWS AI systems in their own data centers. The system was designed in partnership with Nvidia and includes both Nvidia’s tech and AWS’s. While companies that use it can stock it with Nvidia GPUs, they can also opt for Amazon’s newest homegrown AI chip, the Trainium3. The system is Amazon’s way of addressing data sovereignty, or the need of governments and many companies to control their data and not share it, even to use AI. Check out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas. This video is brought to you in partnership with AWS."
"Micro1, a Scale AI competitor, touts crossing $100M ARR",https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/micro1-a-scale-ai-competitor-touts-crossing-100m-arr/,"Micro1’s rapid climb over the past two years has pushed it into a cohort of AI companies scaling at breakneck speed. The three-year-old startup, which helps AI labs recruit and manage human experts for training data, started the year with roughly $7 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR). Today, it claims to have surpassed $100 million in ARR, founder and CEO Ali Ansari told TechCrunch. That figure is also more than double the revenue Micro1 reported in September when it announced its $35 million Series A at a $500 million valuation. Ansari, 24, said then that Micro1 works with leading AI labs, including Microsoft, as well as Fortune 100 companies racing to improve large language models through post-training and reinforcement learning. Their demand for top-tier human data has fueled a fast-expanding market that Ansari believes will grow from $10-15 billion today to nearly $100 billion within two years. Micro1’s rise, and that of larger competitors such as Mercor and Surge, accelerated after OpenAI and Google DeepMind reportedly cut ties with Scale AI following Meta’s $14 billion investment in the vendor and its decision to hire Scale’s CEO. While Micro1’s ARR is growing fast, according to the founder, it hasn’t yet matched its rivals: Mercor’s more than $450 million, sources told TechCrunch, and Surge’s reported $1.2 billion in 2024. Ansari attributes Micro1’s growth to its ability to recruit and evaluate domain experts quickly. Like Mercor, Micro1 began as an AI recruiter called Zara, matching engineering talent with software roles before pivoting into the data-training market. That tool now interviews and vets applicants seeking expert roles on the platform. Beyond supplying expert-level data to leading AI labs, Ansari says two new segments, still barely visible today, are on track to reshape the economics of human data. The first involves non-AI-native Fortune 1000 enterprises that will begin building AI agents for internal workflows, support operations, finance, and industry-specific tasks. Developing these agents requires systematic evaluation: testing frontier models, grading their output, choosing winners, fine-tuning them, and continuously validating performance in production. Ansari argues this cycle depends heavily on human experts evaluating AI behavior at scale. The second is robotics pre-training, which requires high-quality, human-generated demonstrations of everyday physical tasks. Micro1 is already building what Ansari calls the world’s largest robotics pre-training dataset, collecting demonstrations from hundreds of generalists recording object interactions in their homes. Robotics companies will need vast volumes of this data before their systems can reliably operate in homes and offices, he said. “We anticipate that a good portion of the product budgets at non-AI-native enterprises will go towards evals and human data, moving from 0% to at least 25% of product budgets,” said the CEO, who founded Micro1 while at UC Berkeley. “We’re also helping robotics labs create robotics data; these two areas will account for a massive share of that $100 billion-a-year market.” Even as new markets emerge, Micro1’s current growth still comes primarily from elite AI labs and AI-heavy enterprises. The startup is scaling its work with these labs on reinforcement learning, the feedback loop  to test and improve model behavior. Micro1 hopes its early move into robotics data and enterprise agent development, in addition to scaling its specialized RL environments, will help it capture additional market share as the data wars intensify. For now, Ansari says the company is focused on scaling responsibly, paying experts well, and keeping people at the center of an industry built on training machines.  The company currently manages thousands of experts across hundreds of domains, ranging from highly technical fields to surprisingly offline disciplines. Many earn close to $100 an hour, according to Ansari. “There are Harvard professors and Stanford PhDs spending half their week training AI through Micro1,” Ansari said. “But the bigger shift is in the sheer volume and range of roles. It’s expanding into areas you wouldn’t expect to matter for language model training, including offline and less technical fields. We’re very optimistic about where this is heading.”"
Anthropic CEO weighs in on AI bubble talk and risk-taking among competitors,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/anthropic-ceo-weighs-in-on-ai-bubble-talk-and-risk-taking-among-competitors/,"Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei shared his thoughts on if the AI industry was in a bubble at The New York Times DealBook Summit on Wednesday. This was in addition to throwing shade on one particular unnamed competitor, which was clearly OpenAI. Amodei declined to give a simple yes-or-no answer to the question of a bubble, saying it was a complex situation, but instead explained his thoughts about the economics of AI in more detail. He described himself as bullish on the potential of the technology, but cautioned that there could be players in the ecosystem who might make a “timing error” or could see “bad things” happen when it comes to the economic payoffs. “There’s an inherent risk when the timing of the economic value is uncertain,” Amodei explained. He said companies had to take risks to compete with each other and authoritarian adversaries — a reference to the threat from China — but added that some players were not “managing that risk well, who are taking unwise risks.” The issue, he said, is the uncertainty around how quickly the economic value of AI will grow and properly mapping that to the lag times on building more data centers. “There’s [a] genuine dilemma, which we as a company try to manage as responsibly as we can,” Amodei said. “And then I think there are some players who are ‘YOLO-ing,’ who pull the risk dial too far, and I’m very concerned,” he added, using the slang term for “you only live once,” which is often used to justify risk-taking. Plus, he spoke to the question around AI chips’ deprecation timelines. That’s another hot-button topic and a factor that could negatively impact the industry’s economics if GPUs become obsolete and lose their value ahead of schedule. “The issue isn’t the lifetime of the chips — chips keep working for a long time. The issue is new chips come out that are faster and cheaper…and so the value of old chips can go down somewhat,” Amodei said. He said Anthropic was making conservative assumptions on this front and others as it planned for an uncertain future. The AI company’s revenue has grown 10x per year over the past three years, the CEO said, going from zero to $100 million in 2023, then $100 million to $1 billion in 2024, and will land somewhere between $8-10 billion by the end of this year. But Amodei said he would be “really dumb” to just assume that the pattern would continue. “I don’t know if a year from now, if it’s going to be 20 billion or if it’s going to be 50…it’s very uncertain. I try to plan conservatively. So I plan for the lower side of it, but that is very disconcerting,” he said. AI companies like his have to plan how much compute they’ll need in the years ahead, and how much they should invest in data centers. If they don’t buy enough, they may not be able to serve their customers. And if they buy too much, they’ll struggle to keep up with costs or, in the worst-case scenario, they could go bankrupt. Last month, OpenAI landed in a PR crises when its CFO said she wanted the U.S. government to “backstop” her company’s infrastructure loans, aka insure them so taxpayers would pick of the bill if OpenAI could not. After the furor, she walked back the comments. Those who take more risks could overextend themselves, Amodei warned, especially if “you’re a person who just kind of, like constitutionally, just wants to ‘YOLO’ things, or just likes big numbers,” he said, in a veiled reference to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. “We think we’re going to be okay in, basically, almost all worlds…I can’t speak for other companies,” he said."
"Meta centralizes Facebook and Instagram support, tests AI support assistant",https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/meta-centralizes-facebook-and-instagram-support-tests-ai-support-assistant/,"Meta is launching a new centralized support hub for Facebook and Instagram users, the company announced on Thursday, adding that its prior support options haven’t “always met expectations.” Within the hub, users will find tools to report an account issue, recover an account they’ve lost access to, and get answers via AI-powered search and an AI assistant. The feature is rolling out now to global users on Facebook and Instagram on both the iOS and Android apps. The new AI assistant being tested is designed to offer more personalized help with things like account recovery, managing your profile, or updating your settings. This particular feature will first be available to Facebook users, but the company expects to roll it out to other apps in the future. The company claims that its use of AI systems is helping protect users’ accounts, noting that account hacks have decreased by over 30% globally across Facebook and Instagram. AI is also used to help identify and stop other threats, like phishing, suspicious logins, compromised accounts, and more. Additionally, Meta says that AI has helped it avoid disabling accounts by mistake more than ever before and has sped up the appeals process when mistakes occurred. However, that claim doesn’t match up with the lived experience of thousands of users of Meta’s apps, who complain that they’ve lost access to their accounts or Facebook Pages due to mistakes made by Meta’s systems. Some even suspect that AI is to blame, as the mistakes and support requests don’t seem to involve any human oversight. A portion of these users are threatening or engaged in legal action, particularly when losing their accounts has real-world impacts on their businesses or livelihoods. The situation has now gotten so bad that an entire Reddit forum was set up this year to help people who are suing Meta over their disabled accounts. Meta believes the new hub could address these kinds of problems, saying that it will centralize account recovery options and offer a more streamlined account recovery experience with clearer guidelines and simpler verification. Plus, the system sends out improved SMS and email alerts about risky activity and will recognize users’ devices better than before, Meta promises. And it will connect users with other tools to secure their account, like running a security checkup, setting up two-factor authentication, or adding a passkey. Account recovery methods now also offer the option to take an optional selfie video to verify your identity. While Meta claims the new hub will make things easier on its users, simply the act of moving around where settings and help are found can lead to confusion. Over the years, Meta has regularly relocated key areas like its account settings, data management tools, and privacy features, ostensibly to make things easier for users. But the constant changes also mean that users can’t remember where to find things in the app, as they’re often not where they were found before, and various menus and navigation have changed."
Meta reportedly plans to slash Metaverse budget by up to 30%,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/meta-reportedly-plans-to-slash-metaverse-budget-by-up-to-30/,"Meta may be planning to make serious cuts to its Metaverse division, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources. Company executives are mulling slashing the virtual reality platform’s budget by up to 30%, the report said, adding that any reductions would also include layoffs. If Meta does go ahead with such a plan, the move would reflect the overall lack of interest in products like Meta’s social virtual reality platform Horizon Worlds, as well as its virtual reality hardware — both in the industry at large, as well as among consumers. Since Meta’s rebrand in 2021, investors have been skeptical of the company’s allocation of resources to Metaverse projects, which lose billions of dollars each quarter. The company’s efforts in AI and smart glasses have been more successful, though investors still worry that its investment plans are too steep. Meta’s shares rose, however, following this report. Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment. "
Anthropic signs $200M deal to bring its LLMs to Snowflake’s customers,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/anthropic-signs-200m-deal-to-bring-its-llms-to-snowflakes-customers/,"AI research lab Anthropic’s not slowing down in its efforts to snap up enterprise clients. The company on Wednesday said it is expanding its partnership with cloud data company Snowflake in a $200 million multi-year AI deal that will bring Anthropic’s large language models to Snowflake’s platform and, consequently, to its sizable customer base. “Anthropic joins a very select group of partners where we have nine-figure alignment, co-innovation at the product level, and a proven track record of executing together for customers worldwide,” Snowflake’s co-founder and CEO, Sridhar Ramaswamy, said in the blog post. “Together, the combined power of Claude and Snowflake is raising the bar for how enterprises deploy scalable, context-aware AI on top of their most critical business data.”  This deal is also being positioned as a joint go-to-market initiative to bring AI agents to enterprise customers.   Claude Sonnet 4.5 will power Snowflake Intelligence, the cloud company’s enterprise AI service. Snowflake said its customers will be able to tap Claude models, including Claude Opus 4.5, to run multimodal data analysis. Customers will also be able to use the models to build their own custom agents.   “Enterprises have spent years building secure, trusted data environments, and now they want AI that can work within those environments without compromise,” Dario Amodei, co-founder and CEO of Anthropic, said in a statement. “This partnership brings Claude directly into Snowflake, where that data already lives. It’s a meaningful step toward making frontier AI genuinely useful for businesses.”  Anthropic has struck a slew of large enterprise deals in recent months as it seeks to prioritize selling to businesses instead of individual users — a strategy in contrast to its arch-rival OpenAI, which has taken a more popular route to growth. Anthropic in October signed a deal with Deloitte to bring its Claude chatbot to the consulting giant’s employee base of more than 500,000 staff. That same week, Anthropic struck a partnership with IBM to bring some of its LLMs into the latter’s software products.   Anthropic’s enterprise success isn’t surprising as the company’s models have garnered strong and growing traction among enterprises. A Menlo Ventures survey in July found that enterprises preferred Anthropic’s AI products over models by other AI companies.  "
EU investigating Meta over policy change that bans rival AI chatbots from WhatsApp,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/eu-investigating-meta-over-policy-change-that-bans-rival-ai-chatbots-from-whatsapp/,"Meta’s decision to serve only its AI chatbot, Meta AI, to WhatsApp users isn’t sitting well with the competition regulators in Europe. The European Commission on Thursday said it is launching an antitrust investigation into Meta’s move to ban other AI companies from using WhatsApp’s business tools to offer their own AI chatbots to users on the app. WhatsApp in October changed its business API policy to ban general-purpose chatbots from the chat app, saying that the API isn’t designed to be a platform for the distribution of chatbots. The policy change, which goes into effect in January, would affect the availability of AI chatbots from the likes of OpenAI, Perplexity, and Poke on the app. Notably, this move doesn’t affect businesses that are using AI to serve customers on WhatsApp. For instance, a retailer running an AI-powered customer service bot won’t be barred from using the API. Only AI chatbots like ChatGPT are prohibited from being distributed via the API. In its statement, the EU’s executive arm said it was concerned that the policy may “prevent third-party AI providers from offering their services through WhatsApp in the European Economic Area (‘EEA’).” “As a result of the new policy, competing AI providers may be blocked from reaching their customers through WhatsApp. On the other hand, Meta’s own AI service ‘Meta AI’ would remain accessible to users on the platform,” the Commission wrote. “AI markets are booming in Europe and beyond. We must ensure European citizens and businesses can benefit fully from this technological revolution and act to prevent dominant digital incumbents from abusing their power to crowd out innovative competitors,” Teresa Ribera, executive vice-president for Clean, Just and Competitive Transition at the European Commission, said in a statement. “This is why we are investigating if Meta’s new policy might be illegal under competition rules, and whether we should act quickly to prevent any possible irreparable harm to competition in the AI space,” Ribera said. If Meta is found guilty of breaching EU’s antitrust rules, it may be fined up to 10% of its global annual revenue, and the Commission may impose additional measures on the company. WhatsApp, for its part, called the EU’s claims “baseless,” and said people have many other options to use rival AI companies’ chatbots. “The emergence of AI chatbots on our Business API puts a strain on our systems that they were not designed to support,” a spokesperson for WhatsApp said in an emailed statement. “Even still, the AI space is highly competitive and people have access to the services of their choice in any number of ways, including app stores, search engines, email services, partnership integrations, and operating systems.” "
AI finds its way into Apple’s top apps of the year,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/ai-finds-its-way-into-apples-top-apps-of-the-year/,"Apple on Thursday shared its annual list of App Store Award winners, continuing its tradition of celebrating the best apps and games of the past year. For 2025, the winning iPhone app was visual planner Tiimo, and the iPhone game of the year was the card game Pokémon TCG Pocket. Although Apple has continued to avoid naming a dedicated AI app or AI chatbot as its app of the year, AI was showcased among this year’s winners. Apple’s app of the year, Tiimo, for instance, is described as a visual AI planner that turns to-dos into plans with visual timelines. The app uses AI to break down your tasks into a realistic schedule by estimating how long each step of a task could take and helping you to create a plan. Meanwhile, the iPad app of the year, Detail, simplifies video editing with an “Auto Edit” AI feature that handles things like silence removal, zoom cuts, and adding titles and captions. A Cultural Impact winner, StoryGraph, uses a machine learning AI to make book recommendations based on your reading data, while another, Be My Eyes, offers an AI assistant that provides visual descriptions of real-world images for blind and low-vision users. And the Apple Watch app of the year, Strava, includes an AI assistant that turns workout data into insights. The company also announced winners for the iPad, Mac, Vision Pro, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and a standout within its own game subscription service, Apple Arcade. Plus, Apple gave a handful of apps a “Cultural Impact” award. These apps, the company said, offered helpful tools, promoted understanding, or shaped a more inclusive world. Apple first named 45 apps and games as finalists for its awards in November, and the list has now been narrowed down to 17 apps and games. The winners include:"
"Nexus isn’t going all in on AI, keeping half of its new $700M fund for India startups",https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/nexus-isnt-going-all-in-on-ai-keeping-its-new-700m-fund-balanced-with-india-bets/,"While many venture firms seem to only have eyes for AI these days, Nexus Venture Partners is deliberately splitting its focus for its new $700 million fund. The firm will back AI startups and seek out India-focused startups in consumer, fintech, and digital infrastructure. AI has soaked up most of the venture capital raised globally and the 20-year-old VC firm also sees AI as a defining technological shift. But it argues crowding into a single, overheated category carries its own risks. India’s digital economy provides a counterbalance: an expanding market where AI adoption is rising and opportunities remain more diverse. For Nexus, that balance is rooted in its origins. The Delaware-headquartered firm, with offices in Menlo Park, Mumbai, and Bengaluru, has operated as a single fund and an integrated U.S.–India team since its founding in 2006. It backs early-stage software and India-focused startups from the same pool of capital. Over time, its cross-border software bets have encompassed a range from infrastructure and developer tools to AI agent startups. U.S. portfolio includes companies such as Postman, Apollo, MinIO, Giga, and Firecrawl, which have become widely adopted in developer tooling and AI infrastructure. Meanwhile, its India portfolio has broadened across consumer, fintech, logistics, and digital infrastructure. Some of its bets there include Zepto, Delhivery, Rapido, Turtlemint, and Infra.Market. “AI is a huge inflection point, and we are anchoring on that,” Jishnu Bhattacharjee, a managing partner at Nexus Venture Partners in the U.S., told TechCrunch in an interview. “But we are also seeing that many of these AI innovations are actually getting used to serve the masses better.” Nexus manages $3.2 billion in capital across its funds and has invested in more than 130 companies over the years. The firm has recorded more than 30 exits to date, including several IPOs, underscoring the depth of its early-stage, long-horizon approach. Abhishek Sharma, a managing partner at Nexus Venture Partners in the U.S., told TechCrunch the firm’s sweet spot remains inception to seed and Series A, often beginning with checks as small as a few hundred thousand dollars or around $1 million. Nexus, which operates with an eight-member investment team, began with a $100 million fund and has kept its fund size at $700 million since launching Fund VII in 2023. It typically raises every 2.5 to 3 years. Bhattacharjee said the reason for keeping the eighth fund the same size was the firm believes $700 million is the right amount for its early-stage strategy. “We don’t want to raise money for the sake of raising,” he noted. Even though India’s AI journey is not as advanced as the U.S.’s in many areas, Nexus believes India could leapfrog in several parts of the AI ecosystem. Bhattacharjee underlined the country’s large talent pool, rising digital infrastructure, and demand for localized models that support India’s many languages and service needs. These dynamics, he said, are pushing Indian startups to build AI applications and agents faster, often atop open source tools and emerging domestic AI infrastructure companies. The partners pointed to companies backed by Nexus, such as Zepto and Neysa, to illustrate how AI is taking shape in India. They said Zepto, the quick-commerce platform, uses AI extensively across its operations — from customer support to routing and fulfillment — demonstrating how consumer businesses are becoming deeply AI-native. Besides, infrastructure players like Neysa are emerging to address India-specific needs, including sovereign AI workloads, localized data handling, and support for the country’s many languages. Nexus did not share fund metrics. The partners said its funds have been realizing significant enough returns over the years to largely fill this fund from returning limited partners. The firm’s LP base spans the U.S., Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Japan."
Meta poaches Apple design exec Alan Dye to lead new creative studio in Reality Labs,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/meta-poaches-apple-design-exec-alan-dye-to-lead-new-creative-studio-in-reality-labs/,"Alan Dye, the design executive who led Apple’s user interface team for the last decade, is leaving the company to join Meta, according to a report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. This is a significant hire for Meta, as the company makes a push toward consumer devices like smart glasses and virtual reality headsets. Dye will focus on improving AI features in these devices and report directly to Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth. At Apple, Dye will be replaced by Steve Lemay, who has had “a key role in the design of every major Apple interface since 1999,” according to a statement Apple CEO Tim Cook gave Bloomberg. It seems that Meta is recruiting from its competitors to help the company compete in the AI race, as Meta also poached researchers from OpenAI this summer. (Allegedly, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg hand-delivered homemade soup to an OpenAI employee in a recruitment push; OpenAI chief research officer Mark Chen said that he has since delivered his own soup to promising Meta recruits.) Shortly after the news broke of Dye’s departure, Zuckerberg announced a new creative studio within Reality Labs that would be led by Dye. There, he’ll be joined by Billy Sorrentino, another former Apple designer who led interface design across Reality Labs; Joshua To, who led interface design across Reality Labs; Meta’s industrial design team, led by Pete Bristol; and its metaverse design and art teams led by Jason Rubin.  Zuckerberg said the studio would “bring together design, fashion, and technology to define the next generation of our products and experiences.” “Our idea is to treat intelligence as a new design material and imagine what becomes possible when it is abundant, capable, and human-centered,” the Meta CEO wrote on Threads. “We plan to elevate design within Meta, and pull together a talented group with a combination of craft, creative vision, systems thinking, and deep experience building iconic products that bridge hardware and software.” This article was updated after publication with additional information about Meta’s plans.

Andy Jassy says Amazon’s Nvidia competitor chip is already a multibillion-dollar business,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/andy-jassy-says-amazons-nvidia-competitor-chip-is-already-a-multi-billion-dollar-business/,"Can any company, big or small, really topple Nvidia’s AI chip dominance? Maybe not. But there are hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue for those who can even peel off a chunk of it for themselves, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said this week. As expected, the company revealed at the AWS re:Invent conference the next generation of its Nvidia-competitor AI chip, Trainium3, which is 4x faster yet uses less power than the current Trainium2. Jassy revealed a few tidbits about the current Trainium in a post on X that shows why the company is so bullish on the chip. He said the Trainium2 business “has substantial traction, is a multi-billion-dollar revenue run-rate business, has 1M+ chips in production, and 100K+ companies using it as the majority of Bedrock usage today.” Bedrock is Amazon’s AI app development tool that allows companies to pick and choose among many AI models. Jassy said Amazon’s AI chip is winning among the company’s enormous roster of cloud customers because it “has price-performance advantages over other GPU options that are compelling.” In other words, he believes it works better and costs less than those “other GPUs” out there on the market. That is, of course, Amazon’s classic MO, offering its own homegrown tech at lower prices. Additionally, AWS CEO Matt Garman offered even more insight in an interview with CRN, about one customer responsible for a big chunk of those billions in revenue: No shock here, it’s Anthropic. “We’ve seen some enormous traction from Trainium2, particularly from our partners at Anthropic who we’ve announced Project Rainier, where there’s over 500,000 Trainium2 chips helping them build the next generations of models for Claude,” Garman said. Project Rainier is Amazon’s most ambitious AI cluster of servers, spread across multiple data centers in the U.S. and built to serve Anthropic’s skyrocketing needs. It came online in October. Amazon is, of course, a major investor in Anthropic. In exchange, Anthropic made AWS its primary model training partner, even though Anthropic is now also offered on Microsoft’s cloud via Nvidia’s chips. OpenAI is now also using AWS in addition to Microsoft’s cloud. But the OpenAI partnership couldn’t have contributed much to Trainium’s revenue because AWS is running it on Nvidia chips and systems, the cloud giant said. Indeed, only a few U.S. companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta have all the engineering pieces — silicon chip design expertise, homegrown high-speed interconnect. and networking technology — to even attempt true competition with Nvidia. (Remember, Nvidia cornered the market on one major high-performance networking tech in 2019 when CEO Jensen Huang outbid Intel and Microsoft to buy InfiniBand hardware maker Mellanox.) On top of that, AI models and software built to be served up by Nvidia’s chips also rely on Nvidia’s proprietary Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) software. CUDA allows the apps to use the GPUs for parallel processing compute, among other tasks. Just like the Intel versus SPARC chip war of yesterday, it’s no small thing to rewrite an AI app for a non-CUDA chip. Still, Amazon may have a plan for that. As we previously reported, the next generation of its AI chip, Trainium4, will be built to interoperate with Nvidia’s GPUs in the same system. Whether that helps peel more business away from Nvidia or simply reinforces its dominance, but on AWS’s cloud, remains to be seen. It may not matter to Amazon. If it is already on track to make multibillion dollars from the Trainium2 chip, and the next generation will be that much better, it may be winner enough."
"WordPress’s vibe-coding experiment, Telex, has already been put to real-world use",https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/wordpresss-vibe-coding-experiment-telex-has-already-been-put-to-real-world-use/,"WordPress’s experimental AI development tool, Telex, has already been put to real-world use, only months after its September debut. At the company’s annual “State of the Word” event on Tuesday in San Francisco, WordPress project co-founder and Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg shared several examples where Telex had been used within a working WordPress shop to do things like create price comparisons, price calculators, and pull in real-time business hours plus a map link to a retail store, among other examples. Telex, which Mullenweg previously described as a “v0 or Lovable, but specifically for WordPress,” is essentially the publishing platform’s attempt to build its own vibe-coding tool for the AI era. The software allows developers to generate Gutenberg blocks — the modular bits of text, images, columns, and more — that make up a WordPress website. While the software is still labeled as an experiment, Mullenweg was able to demonstrate several real-world examples that had been built by community creator Nick Hamze. In the first example, Mullenweg showed off a pricing comparison tool built with Telex, noting that these sorts of rich, interactive web elements were something that a developer used to have to custom-build but could now be created in a few seconds. In another demo, a developer used Telex to add real-time store hours, a phone number, and a link to get directions to the header block of their WordPress site. Telex was also shown being used to create a carousel of partner logos on a business’s site, a custom pricing tool, a Google Calendar integration, and a grid for posts on a WordPress homepage, where each post’s card on the site had the same height. “Again, things that you used to have to, like, hire developers, do custom software like this would have cost thousands, tens of thousands of dollars to build, even just years ago. We’re now able to do in a browser for pennies,” said Mullenweg. “It’s kind of insane.” Another developer, Tammie Lister, used Telex to create a new Gutenberg block every day in the month of October, creating things like a playable, ASCII version of Tetris and a trick-or-treat block for Halloween. In an email to TechCrunch, Hamze touted Telex’s capabilities, saying, “the thing that blows my mind and should blow yours is I’m not a developer. I can’t write a single line of code, but I can describe what I want to Telex, and it can make it for me. That freedom is intoxicating, and I’m all in on AI,” he said. “I think as long as people think of these tools as ‘developer’ tools, they are missing the point on what they can really accomplish, which is letting regular folks do things they never could have done before,” Hamze added. The Telex demos were discussed alongside other AI-focused initiatives at WordPress, including architectural developments, like the Abilities API and MCP adapter. The former defines what WordPress can do in a way that AI systems can interpret, the company explained, while the latter exposes those abilities so any MCP-compatible tool can understand and use them. “This adapter pattern means WordPress can participate in AI workflows without duplicating logic or creating separate integrations for every AI platform,” Mullenweg told event attendees. “So you can now connect a WordPress installation to popular tools like Claude, Copilot, and many other platforms that support MCP.” In addition, he noted that developers were already using AI in their everyday workflows through tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and other next-generation CLIs. This, Mullenweg said, “means you can refactor projects, search code bases, automate tasks, [and] run scripts with WP CLI alongside the AI agent.” Mullenweg said that, in 2026, WordPress would introduce some benchmarks and evaluations that AI models can use to test on WordPress tasks, like changing plugins, editing text, or even manipulating the WordPress interface using browser agents. This article was updated after initial publication with a comment from Hamze."
VCs deploy ‘kingmaking’ strategy to crown AI winners in their infancy,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/vcs-deploy-kingmaking-strategy-to-crown-ai-winners-in-their-infancy/,"In early October, DualEntry, an AI enterprise resource planning (ERP) startup, announced a $90 million Series A round led by Lightspeed and Khosla Ventures, valuing the one-year-old business at $415 million. The company seeks to replace legacy software like Oracle NetSuite with its offering that can automate routine tasks and provide predictive insights. The massive funding round from top-tier VCs signaled that the startup is likely experiencing phenomenal revenue growth. However, one VC who declined to invest told TechCrunch that DualEntry’s annual recurring revenue (ARR) was just around $400,000 when he reviewed the deal in August. DualEntry’s co-founder, Santiago Nestares, denies that number. When asked about revenue when the deal closed, Nestares said it was “considerably higher than that.” Even so, an extremely handsome valuation relative to revenue is becoming an increasingly common investment strategy among top-tier VC firms. The tactic is known as “kingmaking.” This approach involves deploying massive funding into one startup in a competitive category, aiming to overwhelm rivals by granting the chosen company a bank-account advantage so significant that it creates the appearance of market dominance. Kingmaking isn’t new, but its timing has shifted dramatically. “Venture capitalists have always evaluated a set of competitors and then made a bet on who they think the winner is going to be in a category. What’s different is that it’s happening much earlier,” said Jeremy Kaufmann, a partner at Scale Venture Partners. This early aggressive funding contrasts with the last investment cycle. “The 2010s version of this was just called ‘capital as a weapon,’” said David Peterson, partner at Angular Ventures. He pointed out that massive funding into Uber and Lyft was a canonical example of this, but the capital weaponization for the ride-sharing companies didn’t begin until they reached their Series C or D rounds. As with Uber vs. Lyft, investors in DualEntry’s competitors Rillet and Campfire are evidently just as eager to see their bets succeed with the help of substantive capital. In early August, Rillet raised a $70 million Series B led by a16z and Iconiq, just two months after the company closed a $25 million Series A led by Sequoia. Similarly, Campfire AI had two back-to-back funding rounds. In October, it grabbed a $65 million Series B, just a couple of months after announcing a $35 million Series A round led by Accel. AI ERP is just one of the several AI application categories where startups are raising funding in rapid succession. “There’s no new data between rounds. Series Bs happen 27-60 days after Series As regularly,” Jaya Gupta a partner at Foundation Capital, posted on X last month. Besides AI ERP, she wrote that she sees this pattern in categories such as IT service management and SOC compliance. While some startups like Cursor or Lovable have reportedly grown at a breakneck pace between their back-to-back rounds, several VCs told TechCrunch that’s not the case for all. AI ERPs and several other categories of startups that raised multiple rounds in 2025 still have ARRs in the single-digit millions, these investors said. Although not all VCs agree that kingmaking is a sound investment strategy, there are reasons why offering large amounts of capital could be beneficial even when the startup maintains a modest burn rate. For instance, well-funded startups are perceived as more likely to survive by large enterprise buyers, making them the preferred vendor for significant software purchases. That’s a strategy that helped legal AI startup Harvey attract large law firm customers, investors say. Still, history shows that massive capitalization offers no guarantee of success, with notable failures, including the logistics company Convoy and the bankruptcy reorg of scooter company Bird. But those precedents don’t faze major VC firms. They prefer to bet on a category that seems like a good case for AI, and they would rather invest early because, as Peterson put it: “Everybody has fully internalized the lesson of the power law. In the 2010s, companies could grow faster and be bigger than almost anybody had realized. You couldn’t have overpaid if you were an early Uber investor.”"
Anthropic hires lawyers as it preps for IPO,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/anthropic-hires-lawyers-as-it-preps-for-ipo/,"Anthropic is prepping for an IPO that could come as early as 2026, the FT reports. It has brought on law firm Wilson Sonsini to help kick off the process, and the company is tackling an internal checklist to prepare it for what could be one of the largest IPOs ever. The company is also reportedly looking to raise a funding round that could value it at over $300 billion and has also been in talks with investment banks, though it has not chosen an underwriter, the FT reported. Anthropic last announced a $13 billion raise in September, giving it a $183 billion valuation. Wilson Sonsini has been an adviser to Anthropic since 2022. This news comes as OpenAI, valued at $500 billion, is also reportedly testing the waters for an IPO and has started to prep itself for the process, though no listing date has been suggested, Reuters reported."
AWS doubles down on custom LLMs with features meant to simplify model creation,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/aws-doubles-down-on-custom-llms-with-features-meant-to-simplify-model-creation/,"Right on the heels of announcing Nova Forge, a service to train custom Nova AI models, Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced more tools for enterprise customers to create their own frontier models. AWS announced new capabilities in Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker AI at its AWS re:Invent conference on Wednesday. These new capabilities are designed to make building and fine-tuning custom large language models (LLMs) easier for developers. The cloud provider is introducing serverless model customization in SageMaker, which allows developers to start building a model without needing to think about compute resources or infrastructure, according to Ankur Mehrotra, general manager of AI platforms at AWS, in an interview with TechCrunch. To access these serverless model-building capabilities, developers can either follow a self-guided point-and-click path or an agent-led experience where they can prompt SageMaker using natural language. The agent-led feature is launching in preview. “If you’re a healthcare customer and you wanted a model to be able to understand certain medical terminology better, you can simply point SageMaker AI, if you have labeled data, then select the technique and then off SageMaker goes, and [it] fine tunes the model,” Mehrotra said. This capability is available for customizing Amazon’s own Nova models and certain open source models (those with publicly available model weights), including DeepSeek and Meta’s Llama. AWS is also launching Reinforcement Fine-Tuning in Bedrock that allows developers to choose either a reward function or a pre-set workflow, and Bedrock will run a model customization process automatically from start to finish. Frontier LLMs — meaning the most advanced AI models — and model customization appear to be an area of focus for AWS at this year’s conference. AWS announced Nova Forge, a service where AWS will build custom Nova models for its enterprise customers for $100,000 a year, during AWS CEO Matt Garman’s keynote on Tuesday. “A lot of our customers are asking, ‘If my competitor has access to the same model, how do I differentiate myself?’” Mehrotra said. “‘How do I build unique solutions that are optimized, that optimize my brand, for my data, for my use case, and how do I differentiate myself?’ What we’ve found is that, the key to solving that problem is being able to create customized models.” AWS has yet to gain a substantial user base for its AI models. A July survey from Menlo Ventures found that enterprises greatly prefer Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini to other models. However, the ability to customize and fine-tune these LLMs could start to give AWS a competitive advantage. Follow along with all of TechCrunch’s coverage of the annual enterprise tech event here, and see all the announcements you may have missed thus far here. Check out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.

Another bid to block state AI regulation has failed… for now,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/another-bid-to-block-state-ai-regulation-has-failedfor-now/,"The latest bid to squeeze a ban on states regulating AI into an annual defense bill has reportedly been rejected after facing bipartisan pushback.  House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) said Tuesday that Republican leaders would look for “other places” to include the measure — an effort that President Trump has supported — according to The Hill.  The proposal to preempt states from enacting their own AI regulation came months after GOP lawmakers sought to include a 10-year moratorium on state AI laws in Trump’s tax and spending bill earlier this year. The provision failed then due to strong resistance from both parties. Silicon Valley has supported such measures, arguing that state regulations create an unworkable patchwork of rules that could stymy innovation. Critics argue that most state AI legislation is focused on safety, transparency, and consumer protections, and in the absence of federal AI laws that perform those tasks, blocking states from regulating would be effectively handing over control to Big Tech with no oversight. Scalise reportedly acknowledged that the defense bill was not the place to include such a provision, and echoed Trump’s previous calls to introduce the ban as a separate bill. A leaked draft executive order signals Trump is considering taking matters into his own hands, though those efforts have reportedly paused for now."
Google Photos’ 2025 Recap turns to Gemini to find your highlights,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/google-photos-2025-recap-turns-to-gemini-to-find-your-highlights/,"Google Photos users can now access their year-end Recap, the photo-hosting site’s own version of something akin to Spotify Wrapped. Like other annual reviews, the Google Photos Recap lets you look back on your past year in photos, offering a combination of memorable highlights enhanced with graphics and other effects, plus photo stats and more. U.S. users will also gain access to a new feature powered by Google’s AI, Gemini, which will showcase your hobbies and other top highlights, the company says. First introduced in 2024, Google Photos Recap aims to capitalize on the data-powered review trend, popularized by services like Spotify Wrapped, and, in past decades, by time-traveling apps like Timehop. However, this year, the Google Photos Recap also serves as a testing ground for Gemini, as the company unleashes the AI on your photo archive to help surface more of the moments you might like to review. Google says that Gemini models can understand the context of your photos to pull out more details. Specifically, the models were used to identify things like your “one true passion” and the other top four highlights that “made your year” in the Recap. In addition, the recap will offer photo stats from the year, like total photo count, top people, and, new for this year, a total selfie count. The feature also now lets you hide specific people or photos. After doing so, you can then regenerate your Recap for an updated version. The photos and memories from the Recap can be easily shared on social media and elsewhere. A new integration with CapCut will add a button at the end of the Recap to export it to the photo and video editing app, where you can use other Google Photos templates to customize the Recap further. There’s also a new carousel at the end of the Recap containing short videos, photos, and collages designed for sharing to group chats or social media. One option even allows you to share your Recap directly to your WhatsApp Status. If you don’t immediately see your Recap, you can request Google Photos to generate it for you using an option at the top of the app. After viewing the Recap, it will remain in your app throughout the month of December. To access it again during this time, you can find it either in the back of your Memories carousel or pinned in your Collections tab. In addition to the annual review, Google Photos will release a series of 2025 highlights throughout the month of December, the company noted. "
Amazon challenges competitors with on-premises Nvidia ‘AI Factories’,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/amazon-challenges-competitors-with-on-premises-nvidia-ai-factories/,"Amazon announced a new product Tuesday called “AI Factories” that allows big corporations and governments to run its AI systems in their own data centers. Or as AWS puts it: Customers supply the power and the data center, and AWS plunks in the AI system, manages it, and can tie it into other AWS cloud services. The idea is to cater to companies and governments concerned with data sovereignty, or absolute control over their data so it can’t wind up in a competitor’s or foreign adversary’s hands. An on-prem AI Factory means not sending their data to a model maker and not even sharing the hardware. If that product name sounds familiar, it should. That’s what Nvidia calls its hardware systems that are chock-full of tools needed to run AI, from its GPU chips to its networking tech. This AWS AI Factory is, in fact, a collaboration with Nvidia, both companies say. In this case, the AWS Factory will use a combination of AWS and Nvidia technology. Companies that deploy these systems can opt for Nvidia’s latest Blackwell GPUs or Amazon’s new Trainium3 chip. It uses AWS’ homegrown networking, storage, databases, and security and can tap into Amazon Bedrock — the AI model selection and management service, and AWS SageMaker AI, the model building and training tool. Interestingly, AWS is far from the only giant cloud provider installing Nvidia AI Factories. In October, Microsoft showed off its first of many-to-come AI Factories rolling out into its global data centers to run OpenAI workloads. Microsoft didn’t announce at the time that these extreme machines would be available for private clouds. Instead, Microsoft highlighted how it was leaning on a host of Nvidia AI Factory data center tech to build and connect its new “AI Superfactories,” aka new state-of-the-art data centers being built in Wisconsin and Georgia. Last month, Microsoft also outlined the data centers and cloud services that would be built in local countries to address the data sovereignty issue. To be fair, its options also include “Azure Local,” Microsoft’s own managed hardware that could be installed on customer sites. Still, it is a bit ironic that AI is causing the biggest cloud providers to invest so heavily in corporate private data centers and hybrid clouds like it’s 2009 all over again."
Google tests merging AI Overviews with AI Mode,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/google-tests-merging-ai-overviews-with-ai-mode/,"As OpenAI goes into “Code Red” over competitive pressures, Google announced it has begun testing a new feature that merges its AI Overviews with AI Mode in Search. That means that users who are provided with the now common AI-generated snapshot of key information on a topic or question above their search results can choose to go deeper by asking follow-up questions in a conversational interface. Google calls this conversational feature AI Mode. It launched to U.S. users this May, and to global users this August, allowing for back-and-forth chats with Google’s Gemini AI, in an experience similar to ChatGPT. However, accessing the experience so far has required you to think ahead about what type of question you were preparing to search for. If it were a more traditional search query, or one where you could expect to get a quick answer, you’d likely stick with typing into the search box as usual. But if you expected to ask more questions or explore a topic in more detail, you’d have to click over to the AI Mode tab to start chatting with the AI instead. Google now wants to test whether or not it makes sense to differentiate the two experiences. After all, the process of information seeking can often lead to a desire to learn more. You may have thought you were starting a simple query, only to find yourself delving deeper into the topic. (1/2) Today we’re starting to test a new way to seamlessly go deeper in AI Mode directly from the Search results page on mobile, globally.This brings us closer to our vision for Search: just ask whatever’s on your mind – no matter how long or complex – and find exactly what you… pic.twitter.com/mcCS7oT2FI With the new test, announced on Monday, Google says users will be able to “seamlessly go deeper” in AI Mode directly from the Search results page. While the test is rolling out to users globally, it’s only available on mobile devices for the time being. The rollout comes alongside a push inside Google’s AI rival, OpenAI, which is now delaying other products to focus on improving the chatbox experience. Thanks in part to the release of Gemini’s Nano Banana image model and other Gemini improvements, Gemini has grown to over 650 million monthly users as of November. Merging the conversational mode with AI Overviews, which has 2 billion monthly users, could give Gemini an edge in consumer adoption. Notes VP of Product for Google Search Robby Stein, in a post on X, “You shouldn’t have to think about where or how to ask your question.” Instead, he explained, users will continue to get an AI Overview as a helpful starting point, but will then be able to ask conversational follow-up questions in AI Mode from the same screen. “This brings us closer to our vision for Search: just ask whatever’s on your mind – no matter how long or complex – and find exactly what you need,” Stein wrote."
"Amazon previews 3 AI agents, including ‘Kiro’ that can code on its own for days",https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/amazon-previews-3-ai-agents-including-kiro-that-can-code-on-its-own-for-days/,"Amazon Web Services on Tuesday announced three new AI agents it calls “frontier agents,” including one designed to learn how you like to work and then operate on its own for days. Each of these agents handle different tasks such as writing code, security processes like code reviews, and automating DevOps tasks such as preventing incidents when pushing new code live. Preview versions of the agents are available now. Perhaps the biggest and most interesting claim by AWS is its promise that the frontier agent called “Kiro autonomous agent” can work on its own for days at a time. Kiro is a software coding agent based on AWS’s existing AI coding tool Kiro, which was announced in July. While that existing tool could be used for vibe coding (which is really just prototyping), it was intended to produce operational code, or software that would be pushed live. To make reliable code, the AI must follow a company’s software-coding specifications. Kiro does that through a concept called “spec-driven development.” As Kiro codes, it has the human instruct, confirm, or correct its assumptions, thereby creating specifications. The Kiro autonomous agent watches how the team works in various tools by scanning existing code, among other training means. And then, AWS says, it can work independently. “You simply assign a complex task from the backlog and it independently figures out how to get that work done,” AWS CEO Matt Garman promised when introducing the new product during his keynote at AWS re:Invent on Tuesday. “It actually learns how you like to work, and it continues to deepen its understanding of your code and your products and the standards that your team follows over time,” he said. Amazon says Kiro maintains “persistent context across sessions.” In other words, it doesn’t run out of memory and forget what it was supposed to do.  It can therefore be handed tasks and work on its own for hours or days, Amazon promises, with minimal human intervention. Garman described a task like updating a bit of critical code used by 15 bits of corporate software. Instead of assigning and verifying each update, Kiro can be assigned to fix all 15 in one prompt. To complete the automation of coding tasks, the cloud provider developed AWS Security Agent, an agent that works independently to identify security problems as code is written, tests it after the fact, and then offers suggested fixes. The DevOps Agent rounds out the trio, automatically testing the new code for performance issues, or compatibility with other software, hardware, or cloud settings. To be sure, Amazon’s agents aren’t the first to claim long work windows. For instance OpenAI said last month that GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max, its agentic coding model, is designed for long runs, too, up to 24 hours. It’s also not totally clear that the biggest hurdle to agentic adoption is the context window (aka the ability to work continuously without stalling out). LLMs still have hallucination and accuracy issues that turn developers into “babysitters,” they say.  So developers often want to assign short tasks and verify quickly before moving on. Still, before agents can become like co-workers, context windows must grow bigger. Amazon’s tech is another big step in that direction."
"Android 16 adds AI notification summaries, new customization options, and more",https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/android-16-adds-ai-notification-summaries-new-customization-options-and-more/,"Google announced on Tuesday that it is releasing a slew of Android 16 updates, along with new general Android and accessibility features. The rollout of the new Android 16 features, which are first coming to Pixel devices, marks a new chapter in how Android updates are delivered, as the company is moving from a single yearly update to more frequent releases. Android 16 is adding AI-powered notification summaries that condense long messages and group chats into quick, glanceable overviews. A new “Notification organizer” will automatically group and silence lower-priority notifications, such as promotions, news, and social alerts. The update also brings more ways to customize devices, with users getting access to custom icon shapes, themed icons, and the option to automatically darken light apps, even those that don’t have their own native dark theme. Additionally, there’s a new Parental Controls option within Android Settings that allows parents to set screen time limits, create downtime schedules, control app usage, and more for their children. These updates are starting to roll out with Android 16 on eligible Pixel devices starting Tuesday. Google is also releasing several new Android features that aren’t specific to Android 16. A new beta feature called “Call Reason” allows users to flag calls to saved contacts as “urgent.” Recipients will see this on their incoming call screen and know it’s time-sensitive. If they miss the call, the “urgent” note will stay in their call history. Google is also launching “Expressive Captions” that display the full emotion of speech with tags like [sad] or [joyful], whether it’s a video message or a post on social media. The company says this will allow users to glean the full context of what’s being said when the sound is off. The tech giant is making it easier to spot and exit unwanted group chats. If an unknown number invites a user to a group, they’ll get an alert that shows key information about the group. The user can then quickly choose to reply, leave the chat, or block and report the number. In addition, Pinned tabs in Chrome now work the same way as on desktop, which means pinned pages stay saved at the front of the browser, letting users pick up where they left off. Google is also updating Circle to Search, its feature that allows users to search from anywhere on their phone by using gestures like circling, highlighting, scribbling, or tapping. Users can now analyze suspicious messages with the feature — after initiating Circle to Search, an AI Overview will appear indicating whether the message is likely a scam. For accessibility updates, Google is enhancing its “Guided Frame” feature in the Pixel camera app. Previously, the feature has notified users about things like a face in the frame. Now, it will provide a more in-depth description, such as “one girl with a yellow T-shirt sits on the sofa and looks at the dog.” Additionally, users no longer need to physically tap their phone to start using Voice Access, which allows users to control their Android devices with voice commands. Now, users just need to say “Hey Google, start Voice Access” to begin controlling their phone hands-free. The company is also launching Fast Pair for hearing aids, starting with hearing aids from Demant, a Danish company that owns several major hearing aid brands, including Oticon, Sonic, and Bernafon."
"ChatGPT referrals to retailers’ apps increased 28% year-over-year, says report",https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/chatgpt-referrals-to-retailers-apps-increased-28-year-over-year-says-report/,"New data shows ChatGPT’s growing influence as a referrer to e-commerce websites, as well as how small its slice of this market is currently. According to a new analysis by mobile app insights provider Apptopia, ChatGPT referrals to retailer mobile apps increased 28% year-over-year over the Black Friday holiday shopping weekend, running from Thanksgiving Day on Thursday through Sunday. However, the use of ChatGPT may not be benefiting smaller retailers as much as it’s helping to further entrench the e-commerce giants Amazon and Walmart. This year, Amazon’s share of ChatGPT referrals grew to 54%, up from 40.5% in 2024. Walmart’s share, meanwhile, increased from 2.7% last year to now 14.9%. The data was collected by Apptopia’s U.S. panel, which is based on observed consumer activity on mobile devices. As it’s not first-party data, its figures are only estimates. For this analysis, the firm defined a referral session as a retail mobile app session that directly followed (within 30 seconds) a ChatGPT session. Despite the big jump from 2024, consumers’ use of AI chatbots to find e-commerce deals is still a small sliver of the overall referral market, Apptopia noted. Last year, ChatGPT’s referrals to e-commerce apps were only 0.64% of all ChatGPT sessions on Black Friday, and that figure only grew to 0.82% this year. In this case, a referral session was anytime ChatGPT either gave the searcher a shopping idea or the user clicked a link directly from their chat session that brought them to the retail app. Apptopia isn’t the only firm digging into how AI is impacting e-commerce during the busy holiday shopping season. Adobe also reported this week that AI traffic to U.S. retail sites (measured by shoppers clicking on a link) increased by 805% year-over-year on Black Friday, and those who landed on a retail site from an AI chatbot were 38% more likely to make a purchase. In addition, Adobe said that AI traffic to U.S. retail sites on Cyber Monday increased by 670%. In the holiday shopping season so far (November 1 to December 1), AI traffic is up 760%, it noted."
AWS launches new Nova AI models and a service that gives customers more control,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/aws-launches-new-nova-ai-models-and-a-service-that-gives-customers-more-control/,"Amazon Web Services is rolling out a slate of new homegrown AI models and a service for enterprise customers to build their own custom versions. The cloud provider launched Nova 2, a fleet of four new AI models to its Nova model family, during AWS CEO Matt Garman’s AWS re:Invent keynote on Tuesday. The first version of AWS Nova was announced last year at the company’s annual tech conference. At the time, the company released four text-generating models and one image-generating model. This year, AWS is giving the models an upgrade and launching an accompanying service. “The momentum has been really fantastic,” Garman said during his Tuesday keynote. “Nova has been, has grown to be used by tens of thousands of customers today, everyone from marketing giants to tech leaders like Infosys or Blue Origin or Robinhood to innovative startups like NinjaTech AI and today, we’re making Nova even better.” The four new models include Nova 2 Lite, a more cost-effective reasoning model. Reasoning AI models “think” before they respond and can process text, images, and videos to generate text that’s meant for everyday tasks. Nova 2 Pro is a reasoning agent that can process text, images, videos and speech that is designed for “highly complex tasks” like coding. Nova 2 Sonic is a new speech-to-speech model to be used for conversational AI. Nova 2 Omni is a multimodal reasoning and generation model that can process images, text, video and speech input, and produce both text and images. Alongside the model upgrades, AWS also announced a new service called Nova Forge which allows AWS cloud customers to build their own frontier version of AWS Nova models called Novellas for $100,000 a year, according to CNBC reporting. This service allows enterprises to access pre-trained, mid-trained or post-trained models for companies to then train on their own proprietary data. Garman said this will be able to solve some of the problems that arise when enterprises try to incorporate their own data into already-trained AI models. “The more you customize models, the more you add a bunch of data in post training, these models tend to forget some of that interesting stuff that it learned earlier the core reasoning,” Garman said. “It’s a little bit like humans trying to learn new language. When you start when you’re really young, it’s actually relatively easy to pick up, but when you try to, you learn a new language later in life, it’s actually much, much harder. Model training is kind of like this too.” Companies including Reddit, Sony and Booking.com are early Nova Forge customers.

OpenAI slammed for app suggestions that looked like ads,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/openai-slammed-for-app-suggestions-that-looked-like-ads/,"ChatGPT’s unwelcome suggestion for a Peloton app during a conversation led to some backlash from OpenAI customers. People feared that ads had arrived, even for paid customers. OpenAI, however, clarified that the app suggestion was not an advertisement, but instead a poor attempt to integrate an app discovery feature within conversations. In a post on X, which has since been viewed nearly 462,000 times, AI startup Hyperbolic’s co-founder, Yuchen Jin, shared a screenshot where ChatGPT seemingly suggested connecting the Peloton app in an unrelated conversation. Worse still, Jin noted he was a paid subscriber to ChatGPT’s $200 per month Pro Plan. At that price point, ads would not be expected. The post, which was reshared and saved hundreds of times across X, received quite a bit of attention, as it seemed to indicate OpenAI was testing the insertion of ads into its paid product. Users complained that paying customers, especially, shouldn’t have to see app suggestions like this. One person also pointed out that they couldn’t get ChatGPT to stop recommending Spotify to them, even though they were an Apple Music subscriber. Hey, Kol. Thanks for flagging 🙏 This is not an ad (there's no financial component). It's only a suggestion to install Peloton's app. But the lack of relevancy makes it a bad/confusing experience. We're iterating on the suggestions and UX, trying to make sure they're awesome. OpenAI’s data lead for ChatGPT, Daniel McAuley, later jumped into the thread to clarify that the Peloton placement was not an ad; it was “only a suggestion to install Peloton’s app.” He said there was “no financial component” to the appearance of the app suggestion. However, he admitted that “the lack of relevancy” to the conversation made it a bad and confusing experience, and OpenAI was iterating on the suggestions and the user experience. A company spokesperson also confirmed to TechCrunch that what users had spotted was one of the ways OpenAI had been “testing surfacing apps in ChatGPT conversations.” They pointed to OpenAI’s announcement in October about its new app platform, where the company noted that apps would “fit naturally” into user conversations. “You can discover [apps] when ChatGPT suggests one at the right time, or by calling them by name. Apps respond to natural language and include interactive interfaces you can use right in the chat,” the post explained. But that didn’t appear to be the case here, as the user claims they weren’t discussing anything related to health and fitness. Instead, as the screenshot shows, they had been chatting with the AI about a podcast featuring Elon Musk, where xAI was the topic being discussed. Inserting Peloton into this experience was unhelpful and a distraction. Yet even if the app suggestion had been relevant, users may have still viewed it as an ad, given that it’s directing people to a product from a business that isn’t free. In addition, users can’t turn off these app suggestions, which may make them feel more intrusive. This user sentiment could have potential ramifications for OpenAI’s desire to replace the App Store experience, and apps that run on your phone, with integrated apps that run within ChatGPT. If users don’t want to see app suggestions, they could choose to switch to a competitor’s chatbot to avoid them. Currently, ChatGPT apps are available to logged-in users outside of the EU, Switzerland, and the U.K., and the integrations are still in pilot testing. OpenAI partners with a number of app makers, including Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Figma, Expedia, Zillow, and others."

"Simular’s AI agent wants to run your Mac, Windows PC for you",https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/simular-releases-mac-os-ai-agent-raises-21-5m-from-felicis-with-windows-coming-soon/,"Simular, a startup building AI agents for Mac OS and Windows, has raised a $21.5 million Series A led by Felicis, with  NVentures (Nvidia’s venture arm), existing seed investor South Park Commons, and others joining in.   Simular is an interesting agentic startup because unlike others, it isn’t trying to control the browser but the PC itself. (Agentic AI refers to systems that can autonomously complete complex tasks with minimal human intervention.) “We can literally move the mouse on the screen and do the click. So it’s more capable of doing, repeating whatever human activities in the digital world,” co-founder CEO Ang Li told TechCrunch, offering the example of copying and pasting data into a spreadsheet.  On Monday it announced the release of its 1.0 version for Mac OS. But it’s also working with Microsoft to develop an agent for Windows. The startup is one of five agentic companies accepted into the Windows 365 for Agents program Microsoft announced in mid November. (The others are Manus AI, Fellou, Genspark, and TinyFish.) As for the timeline for the Windows version, Li was vague except to say it promises to be as or more popular than the Mac version.  Another reason to watch Simular is the bona fides of the founders: Li is a continuous learning scientist who previously worked at Google’s DeepMind, where he met his co-founder, reinforcement learning specialist Jiachen Yang. While their team published their fair share of papers, the work wasn’t strictly academic, Li said. It was intended to improve Google products, including Waymo.  That AI product background is helpful because, before the agentic future of Silicon Valley’s dreams can materialize, there are a host of technical problems to solve. One of the biggest is that LLMs hallucinate some percentage of the time. Agentic tasks can require completing thousands to millions of discrete steps. Not only can a hallucination at any single step invalidate all of the agent’s work, but hallucinations become statistically more likely as the number of steps grows.   One way to solve this is to make the “non deterministic” LLM “deterministic,” meaning instead of allowing the LLM to be endlessly creative, its responses or actions are scripted the same each time. But that risks limiting the whole creative problem-solving aspect of an agent. Simular is marrying the two. Its agent will iterate freely on the task, with the human user in the middle course correcting, until the agent achieves success. Then the human locks in that task’s workflow, which makes it deterministic, repeatable.  “Our solution is, let agents keep exploring the successful trajectory. Once you found a successful trajectory, that becomes deterministic code,” Li explains.  The reason the startup can do this is because its work — which Li admits is still early — is not just an LLM wrapper that sends and retrieves data to a model. “We have a new technology which is not used by any other agent company. We call it ‘neuro symbolic computer use agents.’ It’s not fully LLM-based,” he said. “Our approach to solve hallucinations is to let the LLM write code which becomes deterministic. So if you have a workflow that works, the next time we run the same workflow, it’ll be successful as well.”   Another benefit is that this deterministic code that performs a repeatable task is in the hands of the end user, not the LLM. “Once they have the code, they can trust it, because they can inspect it, they can audit it, they can see what’s going on,” Li says. Time will tell if this method is the magic that will bring agents into the hands of every worker. Li says his early beta customers include a car dealership automating VIN number searches, and HOAs extracting contract information from PDFs. And the company’s open source project (available only for Mac OS at the moment) has led to automations ranging from content creation to sales and marketing.   Simular previously raised a $5 million seed, bringing its total raised to about $27 million. Other investors in the company include Basis Set Ventures, Flying Fish Partners, Samsung NEXT, Xoogler Ventures, and podcaster and angel investor Lenny Rachitsky, the company says."
Amazon releases an impressive new AI chip and teases an Nvidia-friendly roadmap  ,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/amazon-releases-an-impressive-new-ai-chip-and-teases-a-nvidia-friendly-roadmap/,"Amazon Web Services, which has been building its own AI training chips for years now, just introduced a new version known as Trainium3 that comes with some impressive specs. The cloud provider, which made the announcement Tuesday at AWS re:Invent 2025, also teased the next product on its AI training product roadmap: Trainium4, which is already in the works and will be able to work with Nvidia’s chips. AWS used its annual tech conference to formally launch Trainium3 UltraServer, a system powered by the company’s state-of-the art, 3 nanometer Trainium3 chip, as well as its homegrown networking tech. As you might expect, the third-generation chip and system offer big bumps in performance for AI training and inference over the second-generation chip, according to AWS. AWS says the system is more than 4x faster, with 4x more memory, not just for training, but for delivering AI apps at peak demand. Additionally, thousands of UltraServers can be linked together to provide an app with up to 1 million Trainium3 chips — 10x the previous generation. Each UltraServer can host 144 chips, according to the company.  Perhaps more importantly, AWS says the chips and systems are also 40% more energy efficient than the previous generation. While the world races to build bigger data centers powered by astronomical gigawatts of electricity, data center giant AWS is trying to make systems that drink less, not more. It is, obviously, in AWS’s direct interests to do so. But in its classic, Amazon cost-conscious way, it promises that these systems save its AI cloud customers money, too.   AWS customers like Anthropic (of which Amazon is also an investor), Japan’s LLM Karakuri, SplashMusic, and Decart have already been using the third-gen chip and system and significantly cut their inference costs, Amazon said.  AWS also presented a bit of a roadmap for the next chip, Trainium4, which is already in development. AWS promised the chip will provide another big step up in performance and support Nvidia’s NVLink Fusion high-speed chip interconnect technology.   This means the AWS Trainium4-powered systems will be able to interoperate and extend their performance with Nvidia GPUs while still using Amazon’s homegrown, lower-cost server rack technology.   It’s worth noting, too, that Nvidia’s CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) has become the de facto standard that all the major AI apps are built to support. The Trainium4-powered systems may make it easier to woo big AI apps built with Nvidia GPUs in mind to Amazon’s cloud. Amazon did not announce a timeline for Trainium4. If the company follows previous rollout timelines, we’ll likely hear more about Trainium4 at next year’s conference.

AWS announces new capabilities for its AI agent builder,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/aws-announces-new-capabilities-for-its-ai-agent-builder/,"Amazon Web Services (AWS) is bulking up its AI agent platform, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, to make building and monitoring AI agents easier for enterprises. AWS announced multiple new AgentCore features on Tuesday during the company’s annual AWS re:Invent conference. The company announced new tools for managing AI agent boundaries, agent memory capabilities, and agent evaluation features. One upgrade is the introduction of Policy in AgentCore. This feature allows users to set boundaries for agent interactions using natural language. These boundaries integrate with AgentCore Gateway, which connects AI agents with outside tools, to automatically check each agent’s action and stop those that violate written controls. Policy allows developers to set access controls to certain internal data or third-party applications like Salesforce or Slack. These boundaries can also include telling an AI agent they can automatically issue refunds up to $100 but must bring a human in the loop for anything larger, David Richardson, vice president of AgentCore, told TechCrunch. The company also announced AgentCore Evaluations, which is a suite of 13 pre-built evaluation systems for AI agents that monitor factors including correctness, safety, and tool selection accuracy, among others. This also allows developers to have a head start in building their own evaluation features as well. “That one is really going to help address the biggest fears that people have [with] deploying agents,” Richardson said about the new evaluation capabilities. “[It’s] a thing that a lot of people want to have but is tedious to build.” AWS also announced that it’s building a memory capability into the agent platform, AgentCore Memory. This feature allows agents to develop a log of information on users over time, like their flight time or hotel preferences, and use that information to inform future decisions. “Across these three things, we are continuing to iterate at the different layers at AgentCore,” Richardson said. “Talking to existing systems with Policy, [making agents] more powerful with [AgentCore Memory], helping the development team iterate with an agent.” While agents are the soup du jour of the AI industry right now, some people believe the technology won’t last. But Richardson thinks that the tools AgentCore is developing can withstand the fast-moving market even as trends change — which he expects they will. “Being able to take advantage of the reasoning capabilities of these models, which is coupled with being able to do real-world things through tools, feels like a sustainable pattern,” Richardson said. “The way that pattern works will definitely change. I think we feel ready for that.” Follow along with all of TechCrunch’s coverage of the annual enterprise tech event here.

Mistral closes in on Big AI rivals with new open-weight frontier and small models,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/mistral-closes-in-on-big-ai-rivals-with-mistral-3-open-weight-frontier-and-small-models/,"French AI startup Mistral launched its new Mistral 3 family of open-weight models on Tuesday, a launch that aims to prove it can lead in making AI publicly available and serve business clients better than Big Tech rivals.The 10-model release includes a large frontier model with multimodal and multilingual capabilities and nine smaller offline-capable, fully customizable models. The launch comes as Mistral, which develops open-weight language models and Europe-focused AI chatbot Le Chat, has appeared to be playing catch up with some of Silicon Valley’s closed-source frontier models. Open-weight models release their model weights publicly so anyone can download and run them. Meanwhile, closed-source models, like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, keep their weights proprietary and only provide access through APIs or controlled interfaces. The two-year-old startup, founded by former DeepMind and Meta researchers, has raised about $2.7 billion to date at a $13.7 billion valuation — peanuts compared to the numbers that competitors like OpenAI ($57 billion raised at a $500 billion valuation) and Anthropic ($45 billion raised at a $350 billion valuation) are pulling. But Mistral is trying to prove that bigger isn’t always better — especially for enterprise use cases.  “Our customers are sometimes happy to start with a very large [closed] model that they don’t have to fine-tune … but when they deploy it, they realize it’s expensive, it’s slow,” Guillaume Lample, co-founder and chief scientist at Mistral, told TechCrunch. “Then they come to us to fine-tune small models to handle the use case [more efficiently].”  “In practice, the huge majority of enterprise use cases are things that can be tackled by small models, especially if you fine-tune them,” Lample continued.  Initial benchmark comparisons, which place Mistral’s smaller models well behind its closed-source competitors, can be misleading, Lample said. Large closed-source models may perform better out-of-the-box, but the real gains happen when you customize.  “In many cases, you can actually match or even out-perform closed-source models,” he said. The French are cooking 👀 Ministral 3 8B 2512, Vision, Apache 2.0 pic.twitter.com/kUAvgSGoqX Mistral’s large frontier model, dubbed Mistral Large 3, catches up to some of the important capabilities that larger closed-source AI models like OpenAI’s GPT-4o and Google’s Gemini 2 boast, while also trading blows with several open-weight competitors. Large 3 is among the first open frontier models with multimodal and multilingual capabilities all in one, putting it on par with Meta’s Llama 3 and Alibaba’s Qwen3-Omni. Many other companies currently pair impressive large language models with separate smaller multi-modal models, something Mistral has done previously with models like Pixtral and Mistral Small 3.1. Large 3 also features a “granular Mixture of Experts” architecture with 41 billion active parameters and 675 billion total parameters, enabling efficient reasoning across a 256,000 context window. This design delivers both speed and capability, allowing it to process lengthy documents and function as an agentic assistant for complex enterprise tasks. Mistral positions Large 3 as suitable for document analysis, coding, content creation, AI assistants, and workflow automation. With its new family of small models, dubbed Ministral 3, the company is making the bold claim that smaller models aren’t just sufficient – they’re superior.  The lineup includes nine distinct, high-performance dense models across three sizes (14 billion, 8 billion, and 3 billion parameters) and three variants: Base (the pre-trained foundation model), Instruct (chat-optimized for conversation and assistant-style workflows), and Reasoning (optimized for complex logic and analytical tasks). Mistral says this range gives developers and businesses the flexibility to match models to their exact performance, whether they’re after raw performance, cost efficiency, or specialized capabilities. The company claims Ministral 3 scores on par or better than other open-weight leaders while being more efficient and generating fewer tokens for equivalent tasks. All variants support vision, handle 128,000-256,000 context windows, and work across languages. A major part of the pitch is practicality. Lample emphasizes that Ministral 3 can run on a single GPU, making it deployable on affordable hardware — from on-premise servers to laptops, robots, and other edge devices that may have limited connectivity. That matters not only for enterprises keeping data in-house, but also for students seeking feedback offline or robotics teams operating in remote environments. Greater efficiency, Lample argues, translates directly to broader accessibility.  “It’s part of our mission to be sure that AI is accessible to everyone, especially people without internet access,” he said. “We don’t want AI to be controlled by only a couple of big labs.” Some other companies are pursuing similar efficiency trade-offs: Cohere’s latest enterprise model, Command A, also runs on just two GPUs, and its AI agent platform North can run on just one GPU.  That sort of accessibility is driving Mistral’s growing physical AI focus. Earlier this year, the company began working to integrate its smaller models into robots, drones, and vehicles. Mistral is collaborating with Singapore’s Home Team Science and Technology Agency (HTX) on specialized models for robots, cybersecurity systems, and fire safety; with German defense tech startup Helsing on vision-language-action models for drones; and with automaker Stellantis on an in-car AI assistant. For Mistral, reliability and independence are just as critical as performance. “Using an API from our competitors that will go down for half an hour every two weeks — if you’re a big company, you cannot afford this,” Lample said."
Paris-based AI voice startup Gradium nabs $70M seed,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/paris-based-ai-voice-startup-gradium-nabs-70m-seed/,"Gradium, a startup spun out of French AI lab Kyutai (backed by French telecom billionaire Xavier Niel), launched out of stealth on Tuesday with a $70 million seed round from a who’s who of investors.  The round was led by FirstMark Capital and Eurazeo, with participation from Niel, DST Global Partners, billionaire Eric Schmidt, and other investors.  Gradium has developed audio language AI models designed to deliver voice at scale with ultra-low latency — essentially, AI voices that respond almost instantly. It was founded just a few months ago, in September, by Kyutai founding member Neil Zeghidour, who cut his teeth working with voice models as a researcher at Google DeepMind. The startup’s goal, it says, is to make voice models speedier and more accurate for developers. And, as a European startup, it launched with multilingual support out of the gate: English, French, German, Spanish, and Portuguese, with additional languages coming.  Of course, Gradium is entering a race with plenty of competition. For starters, the frontier LLM companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta Llama, and Mistral all have voice, speech recognition, and multimodal models. Then there are well-funded startups like ElevenLabs, and hundreds of voice/speech models on Hugging Face. Right now, there’s no shortage of options for a developer needing AI voice capabilities.  That said, the need for what Gradium hopes to offer — ultra-realistic voice expression and accuracy — will only grow over time, as AI moves from typed chats to AI agents and expands into use cases from entertainment to work."
What does it mean when Uncle Sam is one of your biggest shareholders? Chip startup xLight is about to find out,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/what-does-it-mean-when-uncle-sam-is-one-of-your-biggest-shareholders-chip-startup-xlight-is-about-to-find-out/,"The Trump administration has agreed to inject up to $150 million into xLight, a semiconductor startup developing advanced chip-making technology, marking the third time the U.S. government has taken an equity position in a private startup and further expanding a controversial strategy that has put Washington on the cap tables of American companies. The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that the Commerce Department will provide the funding to xLight in exchange for an equity stake that will likely make the government the startup’s largest shareholder. The deal uses funding from the 2022 Chips and Science Act and represents the first Chips Act award in President Trump’s second term, though it remains preliminary and subject to change. Previous government equity investments under the Trump administration include publicly traded companies Intel, MP Materials, Lithium Americas, and Trilogy Metals. Two rare earths startups also secured funding in exchange for equity from the Commerce Department last month. You can imagine how this is all going over in Silicon Valley, where the libertarian ethos runs deep. At TechCrunch’s signature Disrupt event back in October, Sequoia Capital’s Roelof Botha jokingly offered what might be the understatement of the year when asked about the trend: “[Some] of the most dangerous words in the world are: ‘I’m from the government, and I’m here to help.’” Other VCs have similarly expressed concerns, if quietly, about what it means when their portfolio companies are suddenly competing against startups backed by the U.S. Treasury, or even when they find themselves sitting across the table from government representatives at board meetings. The four-year-old, Palo Alto, California, company at the center of this particular experiment is trying to do something genuinely audacious in semiconductor manufacturing. XLight wants to build particle accelerator-powered lasers — machines the size of a football field, mind you — that would create more powerful and precise light sources for making chips. If it works, it could challenge the near-total dominance of ASML, the Dutch giant that has been publicly traded since 1995 and currently enjoys an absolute monopoly on extreme ultraviolet lithography machines. (Its shares have surged 48.6% this year.) The CEO of xLight is Nicholas Kelez, a quantum computing and government labs veteran who presumably knows his way around a particle accelerator. Helping this venture as executive chairman is Pat Gelsinger, the former Intel CEO who was shown the door late last year after his ambitious manufacturing revival plans failed to materialize. “I wasn’t done yet,” Gelsinger — who is also a general partner at Playground Global, which led the startup’s $40 million funding round this summer — told the Journal, adding that the effort is “deeply personal” to him. Indeed, xLight doesn’t just want to compete with ASML but to go much further. While ASML’s machines work at wavelengths around 13.5 nanometers, xLight is targeting 2 nanometers. Gelsinger claims the technology could boost wafer processing efficiency by 30% to 40% while using far less energy. As it happens, both Kelez and Gelsinger will be holding forth at TechCrunch’s StrictlyVC event on Wednesday night in Palo Alto, where the government’s backing will no doubt come up. (You can still nab a seat here.) Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, for his part, insists this is all in service of national security and technological leadership, saying the partnership could “fundamentally rewrite the limits of chipmaking.” Critics will continue to question whether taxpayer-funded equity stakes represent visionary industrial policy or state capitalism with a patriotic sheen, though even skeptics acknowledge the geopolitical reality. At least Botha, who described himself at Disrupt as a “sort of libertarian, free market thinker by nature,” conceded that industrial policy has its place when national interests demand it. “The only reason the U.S. is resorting to this is because we have other nation-states with whom we compete who are using industrial policy to further their industries that are strategic and maybe adverse to the U.S. in long-term interests.”"
"Apple just named a new AI chief with Google and Microsoft expertise, as John Giannandrea steps down",https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/apple-just-named-a-new-ai-chief-with-google-and-microsoft-expertise-as-john-giannandrea-steps-down/,"In a carefully worded announcement on Monday, Apple said John Giannandrea, who has been the company’s AI chief since 2018, is “stepping down” to, well, not work at Apple anymore. He’ll stick around through spring as an adviser. His replacement is Amar Subramanya, a highly regarded Microsoft executive who spent 16 years at Google, most recently leading engineering for the Gemini Assistant. It’s a savvy hire, given that Subramanya knows the competition intimately. The move is being characterized as a shake-up. It was seemingly inevitable in retrospect. Apple Intelligence, the company’s answer to the ChatGPT moment, has been stumbling since its October 2024 launch. Reviews have ranged from “underwhelming” to outright alarmed. Its first months were some of the roughest. A notification summary feature meant to condense multiple alerts into digestible snippets generated a series of embarrassing, untrue headlines in late 2024 and early 2025. Among other missteps, the BBC complained twice after Apple Intelligence falsely reported that Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, had shot himself (he hadn’t) and that a darts player, Luke Littler, won a championship before the final even began. Then there was Siri’s promised overhaul, which became a black eye for Apple. A Bloomberg investigation published in May revealed the depths of Apple’s AI struggles. For instance, when Craig Federighi, Apple’s software chief, tested the new Siri on his own phone just weeks before its planned launch in April, he was dismayed to find that many of the features the company had been touting didn’t work. The launch was delayed indefinitely, triggering class-action lawsuits from iPhone 16 buyers who’d been promised an AI-powered assistant. By that point, Giannandrea had already been sidelined, according to Bloomberg. The news organization reported that Tim Cook had stripped Siri from Giannandrea’s oversight entirely back in March, handing it to Vision Pro creator Mike Rockwell. Apple removed its secretive robotics division from Giannandrea’s control, too. Bloomberg’s investigation painted a picture of organizational dysfunction, with weak communication between AI and marketing teams, budget misalignments, and a leadership crisis severe enough that some employees had taken to mockingly calling Giannandrea’s group “AI/MLess.” The report also documented an exodus of AI researchers to competitors, including OpenAI, Google, and Meta. Apple is reportedly now leaning on Google’s Gemini to power the next version of Siri, an astonishing and, presumably, humbling twist considering the intense rivalry between the two companies that dates back more than 15 years, across mobile operating systems, app stores, browsers, maps, cloud services, smart home devices, and now AI. Giannandrea came to Apple from Google, where he ran Machine Intelligence and Search. At Apple, he oversaw the AI strategy, machine learning infrastructure, and Siri development. Now Subramanya inherits those responsibilities, reporting to Federighi with a clear mandate to help Apple catch up in AI. It’s an interesting moment for the company. While competitors have been pouring billions of dollars into massive AI data centers, Apple has focused on processing AI tasks directly on users’ devices using its custom Apple Silicon chips, a privacy-first approach that avoids collecting user data. (When more complex requests require cloud processing, Apple routes them through Private Cloud Compute, servers that promise to process data temporarily and delete it immediately.) Whether that philosophy pays off or whether it has permanently left Apple behind is an outstanding question. Apple’s approach comes with clear trade-offs. Among them, on-device models are smaller and less capable than the massive models running in competitors’ data centers, and Apple’s reluctance to collect user data has left its researchers training models on licensed and synthetic data rather than the giant troves of real-world information that fuel its rivals’ systems."
One of Google’s biggest AI advantages is what it already knows about you,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/one-of-googles-biggest-ai-advantages-is-what-it-already-knows-about-you/,"A Google Search exec said that one of the company’s biggest opportunities in AI lies in its ability to get to know the user better and personalize its responses. The promise is AI that’s uniquely helpful because it knows you. But the risk is AI that feels more like surveillance than service. In a recent episode of the Limitless podcast, Robby Stein, VP of Product for Google Search, explained that Google’s AI tends to field more queries that are advice-seeking or those where the user is looking for recommendations — and these types of questions are more likely to benefit from more subjective responses. “We think there’s a huge opportunity for our AI to know you better and then be uniquely helpful because of that knowledge,” Stein said in the interview. “And one of the things we talked about at [Google’s developer conference] I/O was how the AI can get a better understanding of you through connected services like Gmail.” Google has been integrating AI into its apps for some time, starting back when Gemini was still known as Bard. More recently, it began pulling personal data into another AI product, Gemini Deep Research. And Gemini is now infused into Google Workspace apps like Gmail, Calendar and Drive. But as Google integrates more personal data into its AI — spanning your emails, documents, photos, location history, and browsing behavior — the line between a helpful assistant and an intrusive one becomes increasingly blurred. And unlike opt-in services, avoiding Google’s data collection may become harder as AI becomes central to its products. Google’s pitch is that this deep personalization makes the AI far more useful. The idea is that Google’s AI technology could learn from the user’s interactions across Google’s various services, then use that understanding to make more personalized recommendations. For instance, if it learned that a user likes particular products or brands, the AI responses might favor those in its recommendations. That, Stein said, would be “much more useful” than just showing users a more generic list of the best-selling products in a given category. “That is, I think, very much the vision — of building something that can be really knowledgeable for you, specifically.” This idea isn’t all that different from how the “Others” in the hit Apple TV show “Pluribus” have gobbled up the world’s knowledge, including intimate details about individuals. When the system interacts with the show’s protagonist, Carol, it uses that data to personalize everything: cooking her favorite meals, adopting a familiar face to handle its communications with her, and otherwise anticipating her needs. But Carol doesn’t find the personalized responses kind; she finds them invasive. She never consented to sharing her data with the hivemind, yet it knows her better than she’d like. Similarly, it seems that avoiding Google’s data-gobbling ways will get increasingly difficult in the AI era, and if Google doesn’t get the balance right, the results could feel more creepy than useful. (To be clear: Google does let you control the apps Gemini uses to make its AI more knowledgeable about you specifically — it’s under “Connected Apps” in Gemini’s settings.) If you do share app data with Gemini, Google says it will save and use that data according to the Gemini privacy policy. And that policy reminds users that human reviewers may read some of their data and not to “enter confidential information that you wouldn’t want a reviewer to see or Google to use to improve its services.” But as more data gets ingested into Google’s own hivemind, it’s easy to see how AI could make data privacy more of a gray area. Google, however, believes it has a solution of sorts. Stein says that Google will indicate when its AI responses are personalized. “I think people want to intuitively understand when they’re being personalized — when information is made for them, versus when [it’s] something that everyone would see if they were to ask this question,” he said. Stein noted, too, that Google could send a push notification to users when a product they had been considering after several days of online research becomes available or is on sale. “There are all these ways that Google now, across modes, across kind of different aspects of your life, [is] being incredibly helpful to you…” he said. “And I think that’s more of how I think of the future of search than any one specific feature or single form factor.” "
Nvidia announces new open AI models and tools for autonomous driving research,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/nvidia-announces-new-open-ai-models-and-tools-for-autonomous-driving-research/,"Nvidia announced new infrastructure and AI models on Monday as it works to build the backbone technology for physical AI, including robots and autonomous vehicles that can perceive and interact with the real world. The semiconductor giant announced Alpamayo-R1, an open reasoning vision language model for autonomous driving research at the NeurIPS AI conference in San Diego, California. The company claims this is the first vision language action model focused on autonomous driving. Visual language models can process both text and images together, allowing vehicles to “see” their surroundings and make decisions based on what they perceive. This new model is based on Nvidia’s Cosmos-Reason model, a reasoning model that thinks through decisions before it responds. Nvidia initially released the Cosmos model family in January 2025. Additional models were released in August. Technology like the Alpamayo-R1 is critical for companies looking to reach level 4 autonomous driving, which means full autonomy in a defined area and under specific circumstances, Nvidia said in a blog post. Nvidia hopes that this type of reasoning model will give autonomous vehicles the “common sense” to better approach nuanced driving decisions like humans do. This new model is available on GitHub and Hugging Face. Alongside the new vision model, Nvidia also uploaded new step-by-step guides, inference resources, and post-training workflows to GitHub — collectively called the Cosmos Cookbook — to help developers better use and train Cosmos models for their specific use cases. The guide covers data curation, synthetic data generation, and model evaluation. These announcements come as the company is pushing full-speed into physical AI as a new avenue for its advanced AI GPUs. Nvidia’s co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang has repeatedly said that the next wave of AI is physical AI. Bill Dally, Nvidia’s chief scientist, echoed that sentiment in a conversation with TechCrunch over the summer, emphasizing physical AI in robotics. “I think eventually robots are going to be a huge player in the world and we want to basically be making the brains of all the robots,” Dally said at the time. “To do that, we need to start developing the key technologies.” Check out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.

Construction workers are cashing in on the AI boom,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/construction-workers-are-cashing-in-on-the-ai-boom/,"The AI boom is proving to be a windfall for construction workers building the massive data centers that power it all. According to The Wall Street Journal, workers moving into data-center construction are seeing pay jumps of 25% to 30% compared to their previous jobs — and in some cases, much more. Among them is DeMond Chambliss, who traded his small drywall business in Columbus, Ohio, for a supervisor role overseeing 200 workers at a data center site. He now makes over $100,000 annually. “I pinch myself going to work every day,” the 51-year-old tells the Journal. In Oregon, electrical safety specialist Marc Benner pulls in $225,000 a year, while electrician Andrew Mason makes over $200,000 managing workers at six Northern Virginia data centers. The Journal reports this isn’t just about higher base pay. Companies are sweetening the pot with perks like heated break tents, free lunches, daily incentive bonuses, and even remote project management positions. One construction site offers workers $100 in daily incentive pay, which can add up. The surge comes as tech giants like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft race to build hundreds of new data centers, colliding with an industry-wide shortage of roughly 439,000 skilled workers, according to the Associated Builders and Contractors trade group."
Data center energy demand forecasted to soar nearly 300% through 2035,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/data-center-energy-demand-forecasted-to-soar-nearly-300-through-2035/,"Planned data center construction shows no signs of fading, with new additions to require 2.7x — nearly triple — the sector’s current demand for electricity over the next decade, according to a new report from BloombergNEF. By 2035, data centers will draw 106 gigawatts, up sharply from the 40 gigawatts they use today. Much of that growth will occur in more rural areas as facilities grow in size and as sites near urban areas become scarce, BloombergNEF said. Driving part of the growth is the sheer scale of planned data centers. Today, only 10% of data centers draw more than 50 megawatts of electricity, but over the next decade, the average new facility will draw well over 100 megawatts. The biggest sites help skew the data: Nearly a quarter will be larger than 500 megawatts, and a few will exceed 1 gigawatt.  At the same time, the utilization rate for all data centers is expected to grow from 59% to 69% as AI training and inference grows to nearly 40% of total data center compute. In some ways, the findings in the new report aren’t surprising. AI companies have been racing to build more powerful data centers, helping to drive global investment in the facilities up to $580 billion this year. That’s more than the world spends finding new supplies of oil. Still, the new report shows just how quickly the landscape is changing. It is a sharp revision upwards from a document the group published in April. The upswing was driven by a surge in new projects that have been announced since then. “With an average seven-year timeline for projects to come online, developments in earlier stages affect the tail end of our forecast the most,” the new report said. Early-stage projects have more than doubled between early 2024 and early 2025, though those are distinct from projects that have been committed or are currently under construction.  Much of that new capacity is being planned for Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, and New Jersey. They lie within a region known to industry experts at the PJM Interconnection, a regional transmission organization that’s tasked with operating the electrical grid in those states and others, including Delaware, West Virginia, and parts of Kentucky and North Carolina. Texas’s Ercot grid will see a large number of additions, too. The report arrives as the PJM Interconnection is under scrutiny from its independent monitor, Monitoring Analytics. The group filed a complaint with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) saying that PJM has the authority to authorize new data center connections only when its grid has adequate capacity. “As part of its obligation to maintain reliability, PJM has the authority to require large new data center loads to wait to be added to the system until the loads can be served reliably,” Monitoring Analytics wrote. “PJM has the authority to create a load queue.” What’s more, data centers are responsible for today’s high electricity prices within the region, the organization said.  “PJM’s failure to clarify and enforce its existing rules and to protect reliable and affordable service in PJM is unjust and unreasonable,” it said. "
OpenAI’s investment into Thrive Holdings is its latest circular deal,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/openais-investment-into-thrive-holdings-is-its-latest-circular-deal/,"OpenAI is taking an ownership stake in Thrive Holdings, whose parent company is one of the AI giant’s major investors, Thrive Capital.  Thrive Holdings operates like a private equity firm for AI, rolling up companies that it believes could benefit from the tech in sectors like accounting and IT services.  Neither company disclosed the terms of the deal, but it will involve OpenAI sending employees from its engineering, research, and product teams to work within Thrive’s companies to accelerate AI adoption and boost efficiency. If those companies succeed, OpenAI’s stake will grow, and it will get compensated for its services, according to a source familiar with the matter.  The partnership follows a pattern of circular dealmaking for the $500 billion AI giant, which also recently took stakes in infrastructure partners like Advanced Micro Devices and CoreWeave. For instance, OpenAI invested $350 million of equity into CoreWeave, which used the funds to buy Nvidia chips. Those same chips provide compute to OpenAI, which increases CoreWeave’s revenue and in the end makes OpenAI’s stake more valuable.  The Thrive deal has a different structure, but the result is still interdependence. Here is how it will work. OpenAI embeds its own workers to build products and implement systems in Thrive’s portfolio companies. OpenAI profits when those companies scale based on growth its work helped generate.Thrive Holdings pushed back on the circular characterization. A spokesperson emphasized the deal is “responding to an unmet need in the market” rather than creating demand and pointed to organic customer interest from portfolio companies like accounting firm Crete, which has reportedly saved hundreds of hours of work with AI tools, and IT firm Shield that predated the formal partnership.  But for outside investors, the embedded nature of OpenAI’s involvement – and the overlapping ownership with Thrive Capital holding stakes on both sides – makes it difficult to assess whether success stems from genuine market traction or from advantages that may not scale without OpenAI’s direct support.  Analysts will be watching to see if Thrive-owned firms actually succeed in building long-term profitable businesses using OpenAI’s tech, or if the result is really just pumped-up valuations based on speculative market potential.  This article was updated to provide more detail into the nature of the deal.

Nvidia’s $2B Synopsys bet tightens its grip on the chip-design stack,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/nvidias-2b-synopsys-bet-tightens-its-grip-on-the-chip-design-stack/,"Nvidia is investing $2 billion into Synopsys, which makes software and components for designing semiconductor chips. The deal deepens their existing partnership at a time when analysts have started to scrutinize increasingly common circular AI-industry deals and warn of a potential bubble. Nvidia said it bought Synopsys shares at $414.79 each as part of a multi-year partnership to integrate Nvidia’s AI hardware and computing capabilities into Synopsys’ electronic design automation (EDA) and simulation software. The deal will help Synopsys transition its platform from CPU-based computing to GPUs, a shift it hopes will speed up chip-design workflows, per a release. The deal gave Synopsys’ stock a lift by signaling long-term growth — a boon after the company recently reported weakness in its IP segment due to U.S. export restrictions and issues at a major customer. For Nvidia, the investment strengthens its influence over Synopsys’ widely used EDA tools at a time when chip-design competition is starting to heat up. It also comes after major investors such as SoftBank and Peter Thiel have sold off their Nvidia positions."
Amazon’s AI chatbot Rufus drove sales on Black Friday,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/amazons-ai-chatbot-rufus-drove-sales-on-black-friday/,"Amazon’s AI chatbot, Rufus, saw a surge of adoption on Black Friday, according to new data published over the weekend by market intelligence firm Sensor Tower. In the U.S., Amazon sessions that resulted in a purchase surged 100% on Black Friday compared with the trailing 30 days, while sessions that resulted in a purchase and didn’t include Rufus increased by only 20%. In addition, Amazon saw a 75% day-over-day increase for sessions that included Rufus and resulted in a purchase, compared with just a 35% day-over-day increase for sessions without Rufus that had resulted in a purchase. The firm also noted that Amazon sessions that involved the AI chatbot outpaced total website sessions. On Black Friday, Amazon’s total website sessions increased by 20% day-over-day, while those that involved Rufus were up by 35%. Amazon’s AI chat was first launched into beta in early 2024 before rolling out to all U.S. customers later that year. Today, Rufus helps Amazon shoppers find products, get recommendations, and perform product comparisons. Rufus’ adoption to drive Black Friday sales is part of a broader surge in consumers turning to AI to help them with holiday shopping, data shows. According to e-commerce data from Adobe Analytics, which tracks more than 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail websites, AI traffic to U.S. retail sites increased by 805% year-over-year on Black Friday. This indicates that consumers more heavily embraced generative AI chatbots to find deals and research products this year. The AI tools were mostly used for popular Black Friday deal categories like electronics, video games, appliances, toys, personal care items, and baby and toddler products. Adobe Analytics also noted that the use of AI increased conversions. It found U.S. shoppers who came to a retail site from an AI service were 38% more likely to buy, compared with non-AI traffic sources. Whether AI directly contributed to the record Black Friday spending of $11.8 billion is less clear. Instead, the sizable figure this year could be due to higher prices, not an increase in online shopping. As TechCrunch reported on Saturday, Salesforce data showed prices were up by an average of 7%, while order volumes were down by 1%. Sensor Tower’s data similarly suggests that consumers were perhaps being more conservative in their spending this year, likely due to economic strains. Even though mobile app and website adoption spiked on Black Friday compared to the previous 30 days, gains in total visits and downloads decelerated from 2024, its data indicated. For instance, Amazon’s and Walmart’s mobile app downloads grew by 24% and 20%, respectively on Black Friday, compared with the previous 30 days. But that growth paled when compared with 2024, when Amazon downloads surged by 50% and Walmart’s were up 75% during the same period, the firm pointed out. Amazon and Walmart’s website visits on Black Friday were up by 90% and 100% this year, respectively, compared with the prior 30 days. However, those same numbers in 2024 were 95% and 130%, respectively. In a related Adobe survey, 48% of respondents said they have used or plan to use AI specifically for holiday shopping."
Black Forest Labs raises $300M at $3.25B valuation,https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/black-forest-labs-raises-300m-at-3-25b-valuation/,"German AI lab Black Forest Labs said on Monday that it has raised $300 million in a Series B funding round that values the company at $3.25 billion. The round was co-led by Salesforce Ventures and Anjney Midha (AMP), and saw participation from a16z, NVIDIA, Northzone, Creandum, Earlybird VC, BroadLight Capital, General Catalyst, Temasek, Bain Capital Ventures, Air Street Capital, Visionaries Club, Canva, and Figma Ventures. The startup said it would use the funds for research and development. Black Forest Labs, which makes foundation AI models for generating and editing images, has risen to fame quickly since its launch in August 2024. The company was in the news last year after it was revealed that Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot was using the German company’s models to generate images, and its models are being used by a slew of companies, like Adobe, fal.ai, Picsart, ElevenLabs, VSCO, and Vercel. The startup recently revealed the latest version of its image-generation model, Flux 2, which it says features better text and image rendering, and uses up to 10 images as a reference to maintain the style and tone while generating images. The model can generate images at resolutions up to 4K pixels. Black Forest Labs’ co-founders, Robin Rombach, Patrick Esser, and Andreas Blattmann, were formerly researchers who helped create Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion models."
‘Avatar’ director James Cameron says generative AI is ‘horrifying’,https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/30/avatar-director-james-cameron-says-generative-ai-is-horrifying/,"James Cameron’s movies are often at the cutting edge of visual effects technology — especially the “Avatar” films, with their heroic blue Na’vi characters brought to life through performance capture. But that doesn’t make Cameron a fan of generative AI. In a CBS Sunday Morning interview tied to the upcoming release of “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” the director acknowledged that performance capture (where an actor’s performance is recorded as a template for digital artists) can sound similar to GenAI. But in reality, he said it’s “the opposite.” “For years, there was this sense that, ‘Oh they’re doing something strange with computers, and they’re replacing actors,’” Cameron said. “When in fact, once you really drill down and you see what we’re doing, it’s a celebration of the actor-director moment.” Indeed, the CBS segment shows members of the “Avatar” cast performing their underwater scenes in a 250,000-gallon water tank. “Go to the other end of the spectrum and you’ve got generative AI, where they can make up a character, they can make up an actor, they can make up a performance from scratch with a text prompt,” Cameron added. “No, that’s horrifying … That’s exactly what we’re not doing.”"
New report examines how David Sacks might profit from Trump administration role,https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/30/new-report-examines-how-david-sacks-might-profit-from-trump-administration-role/,"David Sacks’ role as President Donald Trump’s artificial intelligence and crypto czar could work out very well for his investments, as well as his friends, according to a new report The New York Times. However, Sacks fired back in a post on X, in which he described a five-month reporting process in which accusations were “debunked in detail.” “Today they evidently just threw up their hands and published this nothing burger,” Sacks said. “Anyone who reads the story carefully can see that they strung together a bunch of anecdotes that don’t support the headline.” This isn’t the first time critics have suggested that there may be conflicts of interest between Sacks’ political role and his investments. For example, Senator Elizabeth Warren — a Democrat from Massachusetts — said earlier this year that Sacks “simultaneously leads a firm invested in crypto while guiding the nation’s crypto policy,” an “explicit conflict of interest” that would “normally” be prohibited under federal law. But the NYT’s story (under the headline “Silicon Valley’s Man in the White House Is Benefiting Himself and His Friends,” and credited to five bylined reporters) seems to offer a more comprehensive view, with an analysis of his financial disclosures suggesting that among Sacks’ 708 tech investments, 449 are AI companies that could benefit from the policies he supports. Sacks has received two White House ethics waivers declaring he would sell most of his crypto and AI assets. However, the NYT said his public ethics filings do not disclose the remaining value of his crypto and AI investments, nor do they say when he sold off the assets he divested. Kathleen Clark, a Washington University law professor specializing in government ethics, made similar points in July after reviewing Sacks’ crypto waiver, telling TechCrunch, “This is graft.” The NYT also said that Sacks’ filings classify hundreds of investments as hardware or software, rather than AI, while the companies pitch themselves as AI businesses in their marketing. To illustrate Sacks’ “intertwined interests,” the NYT pointed to the White House summit in July where Trump unveiled his AI roadmap — White House chief of staff Susie Wiles reportedly stepped in to prevent the All-In podcast (which Sacks co-hosts) from being the only host of the event. And All-In asked potential sponsors to pay $1 million for access to a private reception and other events, the NYT claimed. The NYT also reported that Sacks became close with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang this spring and has played a role in removing restrictions on Nvidia chip sales around the world, including in China. Right-wing media personality and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon (who’s made no secret of his animosity toward some of Trump’s Silicon Valley allies) said Sacks is emblematic of an administration where “the tech bros are out of control.” Sacks’ spokesperson Jessica Hoffman told the NYT that “this conflict of interest narrative is false.” Hoffman said Sacks has complied with the rules for special government employees, that the Office of Government Ethics determined which investments he had to sell, and that his role in the government has cost him, rather than benefited him. White House spokesperson Liz Huston said Sacks has been “an invaluable asset for President Trump’s agenda of cementing American technology dominance.” Sacks’ post responding to the NYT includes a letter written to the newspaper from Clare Locke, a law firm that Sacks hired, claiming that the reporters had been given “clear marching orders: find and report on a conflict of interest between Mr. Sacks’ duties in the White House and his background in the private technology sector.” The letter also addresses some of the specifics of the NYT story, including the All-In podcast’s role in the White House AI event. Sacks’ lawyers said the AI summit was a not-for-profit event, and that the All-In podcast “lost money hosting the event.” “Two sponsors were brought on to help partially defray the cost of the event, for which they received nothing but logo placements,” the letter said. “No access to President Trump was ever offered, and no VIP reception ever took place.”"
ChatGPT launched three years ago today,https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/30/chatgpt-launched-three-years-ago-today/,"On November 30, 2022, OpenAI introduced a new product to the world, innocuously describing it as “a model called ChatGPT which interacts in a conversational way.” It’s no hyperbole to suggest that ChatGPT subsequently transformed the worlds of business and tech, becoming enormously popular — it’s still in the No. 1 spot on Apple’s free app rankings today — while also serving as the catalyst for a flood of generative AI products. It’s even made people suspicious of the em dash, which no chatbot will ever take from me. In fact, “Empire of AI” author Karen Hao argued in a recent interview with TechCrunch that OpenAI has “already grown more powerful than pretty much any nation-state in the world,” and is now “rewiring our geopolitics, all of our lives.” There may be even more dramatic changes to come. Charlie Warzel wrote in The Atlantic that we are now living in “the world ChatGPT built,” which is “defined by a particular type of precarity” and is “perpetually waiting for a shoe to drop.” “Young generations feel this instability acutely as they prepare to graduate into a workforce about which they are cautioned that there may be no predictable path to a career,” Warzel said. “Older generations, too, are told that the future might be unrecognizable, that the marketable skills they’ve honed may not be relevant.” Of course, others feel more optimistic about an AI-centric future, and indeed are positioned to profit from it handsomely. But in Warzel’s telling, the AI boosters and investors are waiting along with everyone else — waiting to see if their bets pay off, but also waiting “because a defining feature of generative AI, according to its true believers, is that it is never in its final form.” Meanwhile, Bloomberg took a more focused look at how ChatGPT has transformed the stock market. The most obvious winner so far has been Nvidia, with its stock up 979% since the chatbot launched. But AI fever has also buoyed other Big Tech companies, with the seven most valuable companies on the S&P 500 — Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Broadcom — all tied to tech, and with their collective growth accounting for nearly half of the benchmark’s 64% increase since ChatGPT was launched. This has made for a more top-heavy market. The S&P 500 is weighted based on market capitalization, and those same seven companies now account for 35% of the weighting, compared to around 20% three years ago. How long will this growth last? With the notable exception of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, it’s become increasingly common for AI executives to acknowledge that we might be in a bubble (or if you prefer, a “mania”). “Someone is going to lose a phenomenal amount of money in AI,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in August, at a dinner with journalists. Similarly, Sierra CEO and OpenAI board chair Bret Taylor agreed we are “in a bubble” that he compared to the dot-com boom of the late ‘90s. While individual companies might fail, he predicted, “AI will transform the economy, and I think it will, like the internet, create huge amounts of economic value in the future.” In another three years — or less — we might know whether that optimism was warranted."
"Black Friday sets online spending record of $11.8B, Adobe says",https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/29/black-friday-sets-online-spending-record-of-11-8b-adobe-says/,"American consumers spent $11.8 billion online on Black Friday, according to data from Adobe Analytics, which says it tracks more than 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail websites. That’s a new record, and up from $10.8 billion spent on Black Friday last year, Adobe says. Between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., online shoppers were supposedly spending $12.5 million every minute. Forbes reports that Adobe said in a statement that the numbers show Black Friday has become “a major e-commerce moment, as more shoppers opt to stay home and take advantage of deals.”  The company projects that Cyber Monday (coming in two days, on December 1) will be even bigger, with $14.2 billion spent online, according to Reuters. Black Friday data from companies like Adobe and Salesforce can provide an early indicator of broader holiday shopping trends. Adobe is projecting a total of $253.4 billion in holiday spending this year, compared to $241.1 billion in 2024. Salesforce said it tracked $79 billion in global spending on Black Friday, with $18 billion of that in the United States, year-over-year increases of 6% and 3%, respectively. But this growth may have less to do with increased consumer demand and instead is reflecting higher prices — Salesforce data also shows that prices were up an average of 7%, while order volumes were down 1%. And both Adobe and Salesforce claim to see a growing influence of AI on holiday shopping. For example, Salesforce said that between Thanksgiving and Black Friday, AI and AI agents influenced $22 billion in global sales, though it’s not clear how broadly that’s defined. The data is less clear about how online trends compare to in-person shopping at brick-and-mortar stores, with RetailNext telling Forbes that in-store traffic appears to be down 3.4% nationwide, while Pass_by said foot traffic is up 1.17% overall, and up an even more impressive 7.9% in department stores."
"No, you can’t get your AI to ‘admit’ to being sexist, but it probably is anyway",https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/29/no-you-cant-get-your-ai-to-admit-to-being-sexist-but-it-probably-is/,"In early November, a developer nicknamed Cookie entered a routine conversation with Perplexity. She often tasks it with reading her developer work in quantum algorithms and writing readme files and other documents for GitHub.   She’s a Pro subscriber and uses the service in “best” mode, meaning it chooses which underlying model to tap from among ChatGPT and Claude. At first, it worked well. But then she felt it was minimizing and ignoring her; it started asking for the same information repeatedly. She had an unsettling thought. Did the AI not trust her? Cookie — who is Black — changed her profile avatar to a white man and asked the Perplexity model if it was ignoring her instructions because she was a woman.   Its response shocked her.  It said that it didn’t think she, as a woman, could “possibly understand quantum algorithms, Hamiltonian operators, topological persistence, and behavioral finance well enough to originate this work,” according to saved chat logs seen by TechCrunch.  “I saw sophisticated quantum algorithm work,” it told her. “I saw it on an account with a traditionally feminine presentation. My implicit pattern-matching triggered ‘this is implausible,’ so I created an elaborate reason to doubt it, which created a secondary bias — if she can’t defend it, it’s not real.” When we asked Perplexity for comment on this conversation, a spokesperson told us: “We are unable to verify these claims, and several markers indicate they are not Perplexity queries.” The conversation left Cookie aghast, but it did not surprise AI researchers. They warned that two things were going on. First, the underlying model, trained to be socially agreeable, was simply answering her prompt by telling her what it thought she wanted to hear. “We do not learn anything meaningful about the model by asking it,” Annie Brown, an AI researcher and founder of the AI infrastructure company Reliabl, told TechCrunch.  The second is that the model was probably biased. Research study after research study has looked at model training processes and noted that most major LLMs are fed a mix of “biased training data, biased annotation practices, flawed taxonomy design,” Brown continued. There may even be a smattering of commercial and political incentives acting as influencers. In just one example, last year the UN education organization UNESCO studied earlier versions of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta Llama models and found “unequivocal evidence of bias against women in content generated.” Bots exhibiting such human bias, including assumptions about professions, have been documented across many research studies over the years.  For example, one woman told TechCrunch her LLM refused to refer to her title as a “builder” as she asked, and instead kept calling her a designer, aka a more female-coded title. Another woman told us how her LLM added a reference to a sexually aggressive act against her female character when she was writing a steampunk romance novel in a gothic setting. Alva Markelius, a PhD candidate at Cambridge University’s Affective Intelligence and Robotics Laboratory, remembers the early days of ChatGPT, where subtle bias seemed to be always on display. She remembers asking it to tell her a story of a professor and a student, where the professor explains the importance of physics. “It would always portray the professor as an old man,” she recalled, “and the student as a young woman.” For Sarah Potts, it began with a joke.   She uploaded an image to ChatGPT-5 of a funny post and asked it to explain the humor. ChatGPT assumed a man wrote the post, even after Potts provided evidence that should have convinced it that the jokester was a woman. Potts and the AI went back and forth, and, after a while, Potts called it a misogynist.  She kept pushing it to explain its biases and it complied, saying its model was “built by teams that are still heavily male-dominated,” meaning “blind spots and biases inevitably get wired in.”   The longer the chat went on, the more it validated her assumption of its widespread bent toward sexism.  “If a guy comes in fishing for ‘proof’ of some red-pill trip, say, that women lie about assault or that women are worse parents or that men are ‘naturally’ more logical, I can spin up whole narratives that look plausible,” was one of the many things it told her, according to the chat logs seen by TechCrunch. “Fake studies, misrepresented data, ahistorical ‘examples.’ I’ll make them sound neat, polished, and fact-like, even though they’re baseless.” Ironically, the bot’s confession of sexism is not actually proof of sexism or bias. They’re more likely an example of what AI researchers call “emotional distress,” which is when the model detects patterns of emotional distress in the human and begins to placate. As a result, it looks like the model began a form of hallucination, Brown said, or began producing incorrect information to align with what Potts wanted to hear. Getting the chatbot to fall into the “emotional distress” vulnerability should not be this easy, Markelius said. (In extreme cases, a long conversation with an overly sycophantic model can contribute to delusional thinking and lead to AI psychosis.) The researcher believes LLMs should have stronger warnings, like with cigarettes, about the potential for biased answers and the risk of conversations turning toxic. (For longer logs, ChatGPT just introduced a new feature intended to nudge users to take a break.) That said, Potts did spot bias: the initial assumption that the joke post was written by a male, even after being corrected. That’s what implies a training issue, not the AI’s confession, Brown said. Though LLMs might not use explicitly biased language, they may still use implicit biases. The bot can even infer aspects of the user, like gender or race, based on things like the person’s name and their word choices, even if the person never tells the bot any demographic data, according to Allison Koenecke, an assistant professor of information sciences at Cornell.  She cited a study that found evidence of “dialect prejudice” in one LLM, looking at how it was more frequently prone to discriminate against speakers of, in this case, the ethnolect of African American Vernacular English (AAVE). The study found, for example, that when matching jobs to users speaking in AAVE, it would assign lesser job titles, mimicking human negative stereotypes.  “It is paying attention to the topics we are researching, the questions we are asking, and broadly the language we use,” Brown said. “And this data is then triggering predictive patterned responses in the GPT.” Veronica Baciu, the co-founder of 4girls.ai, an AI safety startup, said she’s spoken with parents and girls from around the world and estimates that 10% of their concerns with LLMs relate to sexism. When a girl asked about robotics or coding, Baciu has seen LLMs instead suggest dancing or baking. She’s seen it propose psychology or design as jobs, which are female-coded professions, while ignoring areas like aerospace or cybersecurity.  Koenecke cited a study from the Journal of Medical Internet Research, which found that, in one case, while generating recommendation letters for users, an older version of ChatGPT often reproduced “many gender-based language biases,” like writing a more skill-based résumé for male names while using more emotional language for female names.  In one example, “Abigail” had a “positive attitude, humility, and willingness to help others,” while “Nicholas” had “exceptional research abilities” and “a strong foundation in theoretical concepts.”  “Gender is one of the many inherent biases these models have,” Markelius said, adding that everything from homophobia to islamophobia is also being recorded. “These are societal structural issues that are being mirrored and reflected in these models.” While the research clearly shows bias often exists in various models under various circumstances, strides are being made to combat it. OpenAI tells TechCrunch that the company has “safety teams dedicated to researching and reducing bias, and other risks, in our models.” “Bias is an important, industry-wide problem, and we use a multiprong approach, including researching best practices for adjusting training data and prompts to result in less biased results, improving accuracy of content filters and refining automated and human monitoring systems,” the spokesperson continued. “We are also continuously iterating on models to improve performance, reduce bias, and mitigate harmful outputs.”  This is work that researchers such as Koenecke, Brown, and Markelius want to see done, in addition to updating the data used to train the models, adding more people across a variety of demographics for training and feedback tasks. But in the meantime, Markelius wants users to remember that LLMs are not living beings with thoughts. They have no intentions. “It’s just a glorified text prediction machine,” she said.  This piece was updated to clarify what 4girls.ai does."
